title: Mort Civile
permalink: "/definitions/mort-civile.html"
body: In French law. Civil death, as upon conviction for felony. It was nominally
  abollshed by a law of the 31st of May, 1854, but something very similar to it, in
  effect at least, still remains. Thus, the property of the condemned, possessed by
  him at the date of his conviction, goes and belongs to his successors, (hdritiers,)
  as in case of an lntestacy; and his future acquired property goes to the state by
  right of Its prerogative, (par droit de ddshdrence,) but the state may, as a matter
  of grace, make it over in whole or in part to the widow and children. Brown
