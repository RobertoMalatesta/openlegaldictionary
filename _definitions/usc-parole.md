body: The release of a prison inmate – granted by the U.S. Parole Commission – after
  the inmate has completed part of his or her sentence in a federal prison. When the
  parolee is released to the community, he or she is placed under the supervision
  of a U.S. probation officer. The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 abolished parole
  in favor of a determinate sentencing system in which the sentence is set by sentencing
  guidelines. Now, without the option of parole, the term of imprisonment the court
  imposes is the actual time the person spends in prison.
