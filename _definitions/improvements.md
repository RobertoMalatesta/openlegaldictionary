title: Improvements
permalink: "/definitions/improvements.html"
body: A term used ln leas-es, of doubtful meaning. It would seem to apply principally
  to buildings, though generally it extends to the amelioration of every description
  of property, whether real or personal; but, when contained in any document, its
  meaning is generally explained by other words. 1 Chlt Gen. Pr. 174
