  France, formerly esteemed the most important in the kingdom. They are Dover, Sandwich,

  They had similar fran-chises, in some respects, with the counties palatine, and
  particularly an exclusive, jurisdiction. (before the mayor and jurats, corres-ponding
  to aldermen, of the ports,) in which the kingâ€™s ordinary writ did not run. 3 BL
