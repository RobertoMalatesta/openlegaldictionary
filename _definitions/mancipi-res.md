  except by means of a certain formal ceremony of conveyance called “mancipatio:*
  (q. v.) These lncluded land, houses, slaves, horses, and cattle. All other things
  were called “res nec mancipi:’ The dlstlnction was abolished by Justinian. The distinction
  corresponded as nearly as may be to the early dlstlnction of English law lnto real
  and personal property; res mancipi belng objects of a mllitary or agricultural character,
  and res nec mancipi being all other subjects of property. Like personal estate,
  res nec mancipi were not originally either valuable in se or valued. Brown
