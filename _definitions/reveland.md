title: Reveland
permalink: "/definitions/reveland.html"
body: The land which in Domesday is said to bave been “thane-lant^” and afterwards
  converted into “reveland." It seems to have been land which, having reverted to
  the king after the death of the thane, who had it for life, was not granted out
  to any by the king, but rested in charge
