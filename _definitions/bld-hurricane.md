title: Hurricane
letter: H
permalink: "/definitions/bld-hurricane.html"
body: A storm of great violence or intensity, of which the particular characteristic
  is the high velocity of the wind. There is naturally no exact measure to distinguish
  between an ordinary storm and a hurricane, bnt the wind should reach a velocity
  of at least 50 or 60 miles an hour to be called by the latter name, or, os expressed
  in some of the cases, it should be sufficient to “throw down buildings.” A hurricane
  is properly a circular storm in the nature of a cyclone. See Pelican Ins. Cb. v.
