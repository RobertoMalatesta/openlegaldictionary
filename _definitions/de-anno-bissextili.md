body: of the bis-sextile or leap year. The title of a statute passed in the twenty-first
  year of Henry III., which in fact, however, is nothing more than a sort of writ
  or direction to the justices of the bench. Instructing them how the extraor-dlnary
  day in the leap year was to be reckoned in cases where persons had a day to appear
  at the distance of a year, as on the essoin de malo lecti, and the like. It was
  thereby directed that the additional day should, together with that which went be-fore,
  be reckoned only as one, and so, of course, within the preceding year. 1 Reeve,
  Eng. Law, 266
