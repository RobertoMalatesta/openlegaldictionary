body: 'In patent law. Any act or substance which is known in the arts as a proper
  substitute for some other act or substance employed as an element in the invention,
  whose substitution for that other act or substance does not in any manner vary the
  idea of means. It possesses three char-acteristics: It must be capable of performing
  the same office in the Invention as the act or substance whose place it supplies;
  it must relate to the form or embodiment alone and not affect in any degree the
  idea of means; and it must have been known to the arts at the date of the patent
  as endowed with this capability. Duff Mfg. Co. v. Forgie, 59 Fed. 772, 8 C. C. A.
