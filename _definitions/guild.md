body: A voluntary association of persons pursuing the same trade, art, profession,
  or business, such as printers, goldsmiths, wool merchants, etc., united under a
  distinct organization of their own. analogous to that of a corporation, regulating
  the affairs of their trade or business by thelr own laws and rules, and aiming,
  by co-operation and organization, to protect and promote the in-terests of their
  common vocation. In medieval history these fraternities or guilds played an important
  part in the government of some states; as at Florence, in the thirteenth and following
  centuries, where they chose the council of government of the city. But with the
  growth of cities and the ad-vance in the organization of municipal gov-ernment,
  thelr importance and prestige has declined. The place of meeting of a guild, or
  assoclatlon of guilds, was called the “Guildhall.” The word is said to be derived
  from the Anglo-Saxon “gild” or “geld,” a tax or tribute, because each member of
  the society was required to pay a tax towards its support
