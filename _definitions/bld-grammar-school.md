title: Grammar School
letter: G
permalink: "/definitions/bld-grammar-school.html"
body: In England, this term designates a school in which such in-struction is given
  as will prepare the stu-dent to enter a college or university, and in this sense
  the phrase was used in the Massa-chusetts colonial act of 1647, requiring every
  town containing a hundred householders to set up a “grammar school.” See Jenkins
  v. Andover, 108 Mass. 97. But in modern Amer-lcan usage the term denotes a school,
  inter-mediate between the primary school and the high school, in which English grammar
  and other studies of that grade are taught
