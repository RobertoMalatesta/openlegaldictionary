body: The action of forcible entry and detainer is a summary proceeding to recover
  possession of premises forcibly or unlawfully detained. The inquiry in such cases
  does not involve title, but is confined to the actual and peace-able possession
  of the plaintiff and the un-lawful or forcible ouster or detention hy de-fendant;
  the object of the law being to pre-vent the disturbance of the public peace by the
  forcible assertion of a private right. Gore v. Altice, 33 wash. 335, 74 Pac. 556;
  Eveleth v. Gill, 97 Me. 315, 54 Atl. 757.
