body: A judgment <n rem is an adjudication, pronounced upon the status of some particular
  subject-matter, by a tribunal having competent authority for that purpose. It differs
  from a judgment in personam, in this; that the latter Judgment is in form, as well
  as substance, between the parties claiming the right; and that it is so inter partes
  appears by the rec-ord itself. It is binding only upon the par-ties appearing to
  be such by the record, and those claiming by them. A judgment in rcm is founded
  on a proceeding instituted, not against the person, as such, but against or upon
  the thing or subject-matter Itself, whose state or condition is to be determin-ed.
  It is a proceeding to determine the state or condltion of the thing itself; and
  the judgment is a solemn declaration upon the status of the thing, and it ipso facto
  renders It what it declares it to be. woodruff v. Taylor, 20 Vt. 73. And see Martin
  v. King, 72 Ala. 360; Lord v. Chadbourne, 42 Me. 429, 66 Am. Dec. 290; Hine v. Hus-sey,
