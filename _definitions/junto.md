body: or JUNTO. A select council for taking cognizance of affairs of great consequence
  requiring secrecy; a cabal or faction. This was a popular nickname ap-plled to the
  whig ministry in England, between 1693-1696. They clung to each other for mutual
  protection against the attacks of the so-called “Reactionist Stuart Party.”
