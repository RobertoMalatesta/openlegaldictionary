body: Representation le the act of one person representing or stand* ing in the place
  of another; and he who so represents or stands in the place of another is termed
  his “representative.” Thus, an heir is the representative of the ancestor, aud an
  executor is the representative of the testator, the heir standing in the place of
  his deceased ancestor with respect to his realty, the executor standing in the place
  of his de* ceased testator with respect to hls personal-ty; and hence the heir is
  frequently denom-lnated the “real" representative, and the executor the “personal”
  representative. Brown; 2 Steph. Comm. 243. And see Lee v. Dill, 39 Barb. (N. ¥.)
