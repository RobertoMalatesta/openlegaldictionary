body: The phrase “by virtue” differs in meaning from "under color.” For instance,
  the proper fees are received bg virtue of the office; extortion is under color of
  the office. Any rightful act in office is by virtue of the office. A wrongful act
  in office may be nnder color of the office. Phil. Law, 380
