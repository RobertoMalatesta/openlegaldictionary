body: In old English law, a small, nar-row slip of ground. Cowell. In modem laud law,
  a small triangular piece of land, such as may be left between surveys which do not
  close. In some of the New England states (as, Maine and Vermont) the term is applied
  to a subdivision of a county, having a scanty population and for that reason not
  organized as a town
