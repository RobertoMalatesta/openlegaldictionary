body: A treatise, so called to distinguish it from Littletbn’s book on the same subject,
  which gives an account of the various tenures by which land was holden, the nature
  of estates, and some other inci-dents to landed property in the reign of Ed-ward
  III. It is a very scanty tract, but bas the merit of having led the way to Littleton’s
  famous work. 3 Reeve, Eng. Law, 151
