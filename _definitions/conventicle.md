body: A private assembly or meetlng for the exercise of religion. Tbe word was first
  an appellation of reproach to the religious assemblies of wycliffe in The reigns
  of JSdward III. and Richard II., and was afterwards applied to a meeting of dissenters
  from the established church. As ibis word in strict propriety denotes an unlawful
  assembly, it cannot be justly applied to the assembling of persons in places of
  worship licensed according to the requisitions of law. Wharton
