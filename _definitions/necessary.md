permalink: "/definitions/necessary.html"
body: As used ln jurisprudence^ the word "necessary" does not always import an absolute
  physical necessity, so strong that one thing, to wbich another may be termed "necessary,"
  cannot exist without that other. It frequently imports no more than that one thing
  is convenient or useful or esseutial to another. To employ the means necessary to
  an end is generally understood as employing any means calculated to produce the
  end, and not as being confined to those single means without which the end would
  be entirely un-attainable. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 wheat 316, 413, 4 L. Ed. 579
