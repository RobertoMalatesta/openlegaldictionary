body: In the law relating to nuisances and similar matters, this term means noxious,
  causing annoyance, discomfort, or painful or disagreeable sensations. See Rowland
  v. Miller (Super. N. Y.) 15 N. Y. Supp. 701; Moller v. Presbyterian Hospital, 65
  App. Div. 134, 72 N. ¥. Supp. 483; Barrow v. Richard, 8 Paige (N. Y.) 360, 35 Am.
  Dec. 713. As occasionally used in crim-inal law and statutes, an “offensive weapon”
  is primarily oue meant and adapted for at-tack and the infliction of injury, but
  prac-tically the term includes anything that would come within the description of
  a “deadly" or “dangerous” weapon. See State v. Dineen, 10 Minn. 411 (Gil. 325);
  Rex v. Grice, 7 Car. & P. 803; Rex v. Noakes, 5 Car. & P. 326. In international
  law, an “of-fensive and defensive league" is one bind-ing the contracting powers
  not only to aid each other in case of aggression upon ei-ther of them by a third
  power, but also to support and aid each other in active and ag-gressive measures
  against a power with which either of them may engage in war
