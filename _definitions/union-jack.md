body: The national flag of Great Britain and Ireland, which combines the banner of
  St. Patrick with the crosses of St. George and St. Andrew. The word “jack” is most
  probably derived from the surcoat, charged with a red cross, anciently used by the
  English soldiery. This appears to have beeu called a “Jacque,” whence the word “Jacket,”
  anciently written “Jacqult.” Some, however, without a shadow of evl-dence, derive
  the word from "Jacques” the first alteration having been made in the reign of King
  James I. wharton
