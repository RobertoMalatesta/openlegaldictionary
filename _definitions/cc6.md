body: second class when the performance of one condition is not obligatory until the
  actual performance of the other; and to the third class when neither party need
  perform his con-dition unless the other is ready and willing to perform his, or,
  in other words, when the mu-tual covenants go to the whole consideration on both
  sides and each is precedent to the oth-er. Huggins v. Daley, 99 Fed. 609, 40 C.
