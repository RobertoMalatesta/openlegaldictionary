body: This is a word of comparison and relation In tenure, the cor-relative of which
  is the word “priority.” Thus, a man who held lands or tenements of two lords was
  said to hold of his more an-cient lord by priority, and of hls less ancient lord
  by posteriority, old Nat. Brev. 94. It has also a general application in law consistent
  with its etymological meaning, nnd, as so used, it is likewise opposed to priority.
