body: The low-est (and most expeditious) of the courts of justice known to the older
  law of England. It is supposed to have been so called from the dusty feet of the
  suitors. It was a court of record Incident to every fair and market, was held by
  the steward, and had Jurisdiction to administer justice for all commer-clal injuries
  and minor offenses done in that same fair or market, (not a preceding one.) An appeal
  lay to the courts at west-minster. This court long ago fell into die-use. 3 Bl.
  Comm. 32
