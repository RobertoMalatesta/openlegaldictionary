title: Denouncement
permalink: "/definitions/denouncement.html"
body: In Spanish and Mexican law. A denouncement was a Judicial proceeding, and, though
  real property might be acquired by an alien in fraud of the law,—that is, without
  observing its requirements,—he nevertheless retained his right and title to it,
  but was liable to be de-prived of it by the proper proceeding of de-nouncement,
  which in its substantive char-acteristics was equivalent to the Inquest of office
  found, at common law. De Merle v. Mathews, 26 Cal. 477
