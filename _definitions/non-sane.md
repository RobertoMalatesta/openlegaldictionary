title: Non-Sane
permalink: "/definitions/non-sane.html"
body: As “sane,” when applied to the mind, means whole, sound, in a bealth-ful state,
  “non-sane" must mean not whole, not sound, not in a healthful state; that is, broken,
  impaired, shattered, infirm, weak, diseased, unable, either from nature or acd-dent,
  to perform the rational functions com-mon to man upon the objects presented to it.
  Den v. Vancleve, 5 N. J. Law, 589, 661
