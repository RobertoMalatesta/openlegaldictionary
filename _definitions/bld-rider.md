body: A rider, or rider-roll, signifies a schedule or small piece of parchment annexed
  to some part of a roll or record. It is frequently familiarly used for any kind
  of a schedule or writing annexed to a document which cannot well be incorporated
  in the body of such document. Thus, in passing bills through a legislature, when
  a new clause is added after the bill has passed through committee, such new clause
  is termed a “rider.” Brown. See, also, Cowell; Blount; 2 Tidd, Pr. 730; Com. v.
