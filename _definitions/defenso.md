body: That part of any open field or place that was allotted for corn or hay, and
  upon which there was no common or feeding, was anciently said to be in defenso;
  so of any meadow grouud that was laid in for hay only. The same term was applied
  to a wood where part was inclosed or fenced, to secure the growth of the underwood
  from the injury of cattle. Cowell
