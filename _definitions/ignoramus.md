body: Lat. “we are igno-rant;” “We Ignore it.” Formerly the grand jury used to write
  thls word on bills of ln-dictment wben, after having heard the evi-dence, they thought
  the accusation against the prisoner was groundless, intimating that, though the
  facts might possibly be true, the truth did not appear to them; but now they usually
  wrlte in English the words “Not a true bill,” or “Not found,” if that ls their verdict;
  but they are still said to ignore the bill. Brown
