body: Any point, space, or division of time. “The word ‘period’ has its etymological
  meaning, but it also has a distinctive signification, according to the subject with
  which it may be used in connection. It may mean any portion of complete time, from
  a thousand years or less to the period of a day; and when used to designate an act
  to be done or to be begun, though its completion may take an uncertain time, as,
  for instance, the act of exportation, it must mean the day on which the exportation
  commences, or it would he an unmeaning and useless word in Its connection in the
  statute." Sampson v. Peaslee, 20 How. 579, 15 L. Ed. 1022
