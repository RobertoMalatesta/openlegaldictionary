body: A religious order of knight-hood, instituted about the year 1119, and so called
  because the members dwelt in a part of the temple of Jerusalem, and not far from
  the sepulcher of our Lord. They enter-tained Christian strangers and pilgrims char-ltably,
  and their profession was at first te defend travelers from highwaymen and rob* bers.
  The order was suppressed A. D. 1307, and their substance given partly to the knights
  of SL John of Jerusalem, and partly to other religious orders. Brown
