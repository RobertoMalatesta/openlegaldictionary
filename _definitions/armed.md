body: A vessel is “armed” when she is fitted with a full armament for fighting purposes.
  She may be equipped for warlike purposes, without being “armed.” By “arm-ed” it
  is ordinarily meant that she has cannon, but lf she had a fighting crew, muskets,
  pistols, powder, shot, cutlasses, and boarding appliances, she might well be said
  to be equipped for warlike purposes, though not anhed. 2 Hurl. & C. 537; Murray
