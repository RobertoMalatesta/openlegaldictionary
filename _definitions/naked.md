body: As a term of jurisprudence, this word is equivalent to hare, wanting in nec-essary
  conditions, lncomplete, as a naked con-tract, (niifluni pactum,) i. e., a contract
  de-void of consideration, and therefore Invalid; or simple, unilateral, comprising
  hut a single element, as a naked authority, i. c., one wâ€™hich is not coupled with
  any interest in the agent, but subsists for the benefit of the principal alone
