body: “It is Impossible to lay down any hard and fast rule as to what is the meaning
  of the word ‘immediately’ in all cases. The words ‘forthwith’ and ‘im-mediately*
  have the same meaning. They are stronger than the expression *within a reasonable
  time,’ and Imply prompt, vigor-ous action, without auy delay, and whether there
  has been such action is a question of fact having regard to the circumstances of
  the particular case." Cockburn, C. J., in Reg. v. Justices of Berkshire, 4 Q. B.
  Div. 471
