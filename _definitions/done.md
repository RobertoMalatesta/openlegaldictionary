letter: D
permalink: "/definitions/done.html"
body: Distinguished from “made." “A 'deed made’ may no doubt mean an ‘Instru-ment
  made;’ but a ‘deed done’ is not an ‘instrument done,’—it is an ‘act done;* and therefore
  these words, ‘made and done,’ apply to acts, as weil -as deeds.” Lord Brougham,
  4 Bell, App. Cas. 38
