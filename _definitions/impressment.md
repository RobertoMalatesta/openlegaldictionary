body: A power possessed by the English crown of taking persons or property to aid
  ln the defense of the country, with or without the consent of the persons concerned.
  It ls usually exercised to obtain hands for the royal ships in time of war, by taking
  seamen engaged in merchant vessels, (1 Bl. Comm. 420; Maud & P. Shipp. 123:) but
  in former times impressment of merchant ships was also practiced. The admiralty
  issues protections against impress-ment in certain cases, either under statutes
  passed in favor of certain callings (e. g., persons employed in the Greenland fisheries)
  or voluntarily. Sweet
