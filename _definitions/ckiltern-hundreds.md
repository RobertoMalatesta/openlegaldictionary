body: In Engllsh law. The stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds is a nominal ofiice
  in the gift of the crown, usually accepted by members of the house of commons desirous
  of vacating their seats. By law a member once duly elected to parliament is compelled
  to discharge the duties of the trust conferred upon him, aud is not enabled at will
  to resign it. But by statute, if any member accepts any office of profit from the
  crown, (except officers in the army or navy accepting a new commission,) his seat
  is vacated. If, therefore, any niem-ber wishes to retire fron^ the representation
  of the county or borough by which he was sent to parliament, he applies to the lords
  of the treasury for the stewardship of oue of the Chiltern Hundreds, which having
  recelv-ed, and thereby accomplished his purpose, he again resigns the office. Brown
