body: 'The most widely used test for evaluating undue hardship in the dischargeability
  of a student loan includes three conditions: (1) the debtor cannot maintain – based
  on current income and expenses – a minimal standard of living if forced to repay
  the loans; (2) there are indications that the state of affairs is likely to persist
  for a significant portion of the repayment period; and (3) the debtor made good
  faith efforts to repay the loans.'
