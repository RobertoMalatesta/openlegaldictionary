body: In conveyancing. The corresponding part of an instrument; a duplicate or copy,
  where an instrument of conveyance, as a lease, is executed in parts, that is, by
  having several copies or dupli-cates made and interchangeably executed, that which
  is executed by the grantor is usually called the “original," and the rest are “counterparts;"
  although, where all the parties execute every part, this renders them all originals.
