body: In common-law practice, the action of trover (or trover and conversion) is a
  species of action on the case, and origl-nally lay for the recovery of damages against
  a person who had found anotherâ€™s goods and wrongfully converted them to his own
  use. Subsequently the allegation of the loss of the goods by the plaintiff and the
  finding ot them by the defendant was merely fictitious, and the actlon became the
  remedy for any wrongful interference with or detention of the goods of another.
