body: 'Negligence, consisting in the omission of something which a party might do,
  and might reasonably he expected to do, towards the vindication or enforcement of
  his rights. The word is generally the syno-nym of “remissness,” “dilatoriness,"
  “un-reasonable or unexcused delay,” the opposite of “vigilance,” and means a want
  of activity and diligence in making a claim or moving for the enforcement of a right
  (particularly in equity) which will afford ground for presuming against it, or for
  refusing re-lief, where that is discretionary with the court. See Ring v. Lawless,
