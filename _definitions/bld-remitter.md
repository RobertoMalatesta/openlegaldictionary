title: Remitter
letter: R
permalink: "/definitions/bld-remitter.html"
body: The relation back of a later defective title to an earlier valid title. Remitter
  is where he who has the true property or jus proprietatis in lands, but is out of
  possession thereof, and has no right to enter without recovering possession in an
  action, has afterwards the freehold cast upon him by some subsequent and of course
  defective title. In this case he is remitted, or sent back by operation of law,
  to his ancient and more cer-tain title. The right of entry which he has gained by
  a bad title shall be ipso facto an-nexed to his own Inherent good one; and his defeasible
  estate shall be utterly defeated and annulled by the instantaneous act of law, without
  his participation or consent. 3 BL Comm. 19
