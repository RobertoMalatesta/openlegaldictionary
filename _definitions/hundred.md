body: Under the Saxon orgauiza-tion of England, each county or shire corn-prised an
  indefinite number of hundreds, each hundred containing ten titMngs, or groups of
  ten families of freeholders or frank-pledges. The hundred was governed by a high
  constable, and had its own conrt; but its most remarkable feature was the corporate
  responsibility of the whole for the crimes or defaults of the Individual members.
  The introduction of this plan of or-ganization into England is commonly ascrib-ed
  to Alfred, but the idea, as well of the collective liability as of the division,
  was prob-ably known to the ancient German peoples, as we find the 6ame thing established
  in the Frankish kingdom under Clothaire, and in Denmark. See 1 BL Comm. 115; 4 BL
