body: "“A marauder is defined in the law to be ‘one wbo, while employed in the army
  as a soldier, commits larceny or robbery in the neighborhood of tbe camp, or while
  wandering away from the army? But in the modern and metaphorical sense of the word,
  as now sometimes used in common speech, it seems to be applied to a class of persons
  who are not a part of any regular army, and are not answerable to any military discipline,
  but wbo are mere lawless banditti, engaged in plundering, robbery, murder, and all
  conceivable crimes.” Curry v. Collins, 37 Mo. 328"
