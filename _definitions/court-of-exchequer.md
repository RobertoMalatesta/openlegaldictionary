body: In English law. A very ancient court of record, set up by william the Conqueror
  as a part of the aula regis, aud afterwards oue of the four superior courts at westmiuster.
  It was, however, inferior in rank to both the king’s bench and the commoli pleas.
  It was pre-sided over by a chief baron aud four puisne hurons. It wus origiuuily
  the kiug’s treas-ury, and was charged with keeping the king's accounts and collecting
  the royal revenues. But pleas between subject and subject were anciently heard there,
  untii this was for-bidden by the Artivula super Cliartas, (1290,) after which its
  jurisdiction as a court oniy extended to revenue cases arising out of the non-payment
  or withholding of debts to the crown. But the privilege of suing and beiug sued
  in this court was extended to the king’s accountants, and later, by the use of a
  convenient fiction to the effect that the plain-tiff was the king's debtor or accountant,
  the court was thrown open to all suitors in per-sonal actions. The exchequer had
  formerly both an equity side and a common-law side, • but its equity jurisdiction
  was taken away by the statute 5 Vict. c. 5, (1842,) and trans-ferred to the court
  of chancery. The judlca-ture act (1873) transferred the business and jurisdiction
  of this court to the “Exchequer Division” of the "High Court of Justice
