title: Perpetrator
permalink: "/definitions/perpetrator.html"
body: Generally, this term denotes the person who actually commits a crime or delict,
  or by whose immediate agen-cy it occurs. But, where a servant of a railroad company
  is killed through the negligence of a co-employe, the company itself may be regarded
  as the “perpetrator” of the act, within the meaning of a statute giving an action
  against the perpetrator. Philo v. Illinois Cent. R. Co., 33 Iowa, 47
