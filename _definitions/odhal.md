title: Odhal
letter: O
permalink: "/definitions/odhal.html"
body: Complete property, as opposed to feudal tenure. The transposition of the syllables
  of “odfcal” makes it “allodh," aud hence, according to Blackstone, arises the word
  “allod” or “allodial," (q. v.) “Allodh" is thus put in contradistinction to “fccodh."
