permalink: "/definitions/usc-precedent.html"
body: A court decision in an earlier case with facts and legal issues similar to a
  dispute currently before a court. Judges will generally "follow precedent" - meaning
  that they use the principles established in earlier cases to decide new cases that
  have similar facts and raise similar legal issues. A judge will disregard precedent
  if a party can show that the earlier case was wrongly decided, or that it differed
  in some significant way from the current case.
