body: A small association for the pur-pose of Intrigue; an intrigue. This name was
  given to that ministry in the reign of Charles II. formed by Clifford, Ashley, Buck-ingham,
  Arlington, and Lauderdale, who con-certed a scheme for the restoration of pop-ery.
  Tlie initials of these five names form the word “cabal;” hence the appellation.
