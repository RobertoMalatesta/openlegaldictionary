body: 'By the common law, approvement is said to he a species of confession, aud incident
  to the arraignment of a prisoner indicted for treason or felony, who confesses the
  fact before plea pleaded, and appeals or accuses others, his accomplices in the
  same crime, in order to obtain his own pardon. Iu this case he is called an "ap-prover,”
  or "prover,” “prohator,” and the party appealed or accused is called the “ap-pellee.”
  Such approvement can only be in capital offenses, and it is. as it were, equlva-lent
  to an Indictment, since the appellee is equally called upon to answer it. Gray v.
