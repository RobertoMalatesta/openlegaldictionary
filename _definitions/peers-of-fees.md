permalink: "/definitions/peers-of-fees.html"
body: Vassals or tenants of the same lord, who were obliged to serve and attend him
  in hls courts, being equal in function. These were termed “peers of fees,” because
  holding fees of the lord, or because their business in conrt was to sit and judge,
  under their lords, of disputes arising upon fees; but, lf there were too many in
  one lord-ship, the lord usually chose twelve, who had the title of peers, by way
  of distinction; whence, it is said, we derive our common juries and other peers.
