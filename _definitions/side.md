body: The same court is sometimes said to have different sides; that is, different
  provinces or fields of jurisdiction. Thus, an admiralty court may have an “instance
  side,” distinct from Its powers as a prize court; the “crown side,” (criminal jurisdiction)
  Is to be distinguished from the “plea side,” (civil Jurisdlction;) the same court
  may have an “equlty side” and a “law side.”
