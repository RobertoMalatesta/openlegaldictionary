body: The name of an English court of record held once in the year, and’ not oftener,
  within a particular hundred, lordship, or manor, before the steward of the leet;
  being the king’s court granted by char-ter to the lords of those hundreds or manors.
  Its ofiice was to view the frankpledges,—that is, the freemen within the liberty;
  to present by jury crimes happening within the juris-diction; and to punish trivial
  misdemeanors. It has now, however, for the most part, fall-en into total desuetude;
  though in some manors a court-leet is still periodically held for the transaction
  of the administrative business of the manor. Mozley & whitley
