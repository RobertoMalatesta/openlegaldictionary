body: That whlch is put before; that which precedes; the foregoing state-ments. Thus,
  in logic, the two introductory propositions of the syllogism are called the “premises,"
  and from them the concluslon is deduced. So, in pleading, the expression “in consideration
  of the premises” frequently occurs, the meaning belng “ia conslderatlon of the matters
  hereinbefore stated.” See Teutonia F. Ins. Co. v. Mund, 102 Pa. 93; Alaska Imp.
