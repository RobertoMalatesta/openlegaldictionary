body: A word mentioned ln 9 Hen. VI. c. 65, by the sense of which lt was ln those
  days a klnd of trade, and by tlie judges declared to be lawful. But Brooke, in hls
  abrldgment, says lt was only permissi-ble by law. It was, wlthout doubt, a nick-name
  glven to those who used to change benefices, as to "chop and change" is a com-mon
  expression. Jacob
