body: The words “with strong hand” imply a degree of criminal force, whereas the words
  vi et armis ("with force and arms”) are mere formal words in the action of trespass,
  and the plaintiff is not bound to prove any force. The statutes relating to forcible
  entries use the words “with a strong hand” as describing that degree or force whIch
  makes an entry or detaIuer ot lands criminal. Brown
