body: This Latin word (comnion-ly translated “meaning”) was the technical beginning
  of that clause in a declaration or indictment for slander or libel in which the
  meaning of the alleged libelous words was explained, or the application of the language
  charged to the plaintiff was pointed out. Hence it gave its name to the whole clause;
  and this usage is still retained, although an equivalent English word is now substituted.
  Thus, it may be charged that the defendant said “he (meaning the said plaintiff)
  is a perjurer.”
