title: Prebend
permalink: "/definitions/prebend.html"
body: In English ecclesiastical law. A stipend granted in cathedral church-es; also,
  but Improperly, a prebendary. A simple prebend ls merely a revenue; a pre-bend with
  dignity has some jurisdiction attached to it. The term “prebend” is general-ly confounded
  with "canonicate;” but there ls a difference between them. The former is the stipend
  grauted to an ecclesiastic in consideration of his officiating and serving in the
  church; whereas the canonicate is a mere title or spiritual quality which may exist
  independently of any stipend. 2 Steph. Comm. 674, note
