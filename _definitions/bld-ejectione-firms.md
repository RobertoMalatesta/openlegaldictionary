  the lessor, reversioner, remainder-man, or any stranger ejected or ousted the lessee
  of hls term, ferme, or farm, (ipsum a firms ejecit.) In this case the latter might
  have his writ of ejection, by which he recovered at first dam-ages for the trespass

  the remainder of it, with damages. Reg. orig. 227b; Fitzh. Nat. Brev. 220, F, G
