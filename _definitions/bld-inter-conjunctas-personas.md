body: Between conjunct persons. By the act 1621, c. 18, all conveyances or alienations
  between conjunct persons, unless granted for oner-ous causes, are declared, as in
  a question with creditors, to be null and of no avail. Conjunct persons are those
  standing in a certnin degree of relationship to each other; snch, for example, as
  brothers, sisters, sons, uncles, etc. These were formerly excluded as witnesses,
  on account of their relation-ship ; but this, as a ground of exclusion, has been
  abolished. Tray. Lat. Max.
