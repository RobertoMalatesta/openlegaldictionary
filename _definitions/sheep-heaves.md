body: Small plots of past-ure, in England, often in the middle of the waste of a manor,
  of which the soil may or may not be in the lord, but the pasture is private property,
  and leased or sold as such. They principally occur in the northern counties, (Cooke,
  Inch Acts, 44,) and seem to be corporeal hereditaments, (Elton, Commons, 35.) although
  they are sometimes classed with rights of common, but erroneously, the right being
  an exclusive right of pasture. Sweet
