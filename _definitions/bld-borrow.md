body: To solicit and receive from another any article of property or thing of value
  with the intention and promise to re-pay or return it or its equivalent. Strictly
  speaking, borrowing implies a gratuitous loan; if any price or consideration is
  to be paid for the use of the property, it is “hir-ing.” But money may be "borrowed"
