title: Feoh
permalink: "/definitions/feoh.html"
body: This Saxon word meant originally cattle, and thence property or money, and,
  by a second transition, wages, reward, or , fee. It was probably the original form
  from which the words “feod,” “feudum,” “fief,” “feu,” and “fee” (all meaning a feudal
  grant of land) have been derived
