body: 'In Roman law. The contract of nomcn, which was constitut-ed by writing, (scripturA.)
  It was of two kinds, viz.: (1) A re in personam, when a transaction was transferred
  from the daybook (adversaria) Into the ledger (codex) in the form of a debt under
  the name or heading of the purchaser or debtor, (nomen;) and (2) a personA in personam,
  where a debt already standing under one nomcn or heading was transferred in the
  usual course of novatio from that nomcn to another and substituted nomen. By reason
  of this transferring, these obligations were called "nomina transcripti-tia.‚Äù No
  money was, in fact, paid to constitute the contract. If ever money was paid, then
  the nomcn was arcarium, (i. e., a real contract, re contractus,) and not a nomen
  proprium. Brown'
