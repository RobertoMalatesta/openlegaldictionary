body: In Louisiana. A marine term used to denote a bottom of sand, stone, or rock
  mixed together and rising towards the surface of the water; an elevation of the
  bed of a river under the surface of the water, since it is rising towards it; sometimes,

  the surface of the water, or is as high as the land on the outside of the bank.
  In this latter seuse it is synonymous with “alluvion.” It means, in common-law language,
  land formed by ac-cretion. Morgan v. Livingston, 6 Mart. (O. S.) (La.) Ill; Holliugsworth
