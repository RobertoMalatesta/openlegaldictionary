body: To say that a person is “responsible” means that he is able to pay a sum for
  which he is or may become liable, or to discharge an obligation which he may be
  under. Farley v. Day, 26 N. H. 531; People v. Kent, 160 111. 655, 43 N. E. 760;
  Com. v. Mitchell, 82 Pa. 349. A promise to be “re-sponsible” for the contract of
  another is a guaranty rather than a suretyship. Bickel v. Auner, 9 Phlla. (Pa.)
