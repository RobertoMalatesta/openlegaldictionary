body: In modern constltutlonal law, the name "plebiscite" has been given to a vote
  of the entire people, (that is, the aggregate of the enfranchised Indlvlduals composlng
  a state or nation.) expressing thelr cholce for or against a proposed law or en-actment,
  submitted to them, and whlch, lf adopted, wlll work a radical change in the constltntlon.
  or whlch is beyond the powers of the regular leglslatlve body. The proceeding is
  extraordinary, and is generally revolutionary in lts character; an example of which
  may be seen in the plebiscites submitted to the French .people by Louis Napoleon,
  whereby the Second Empire wns es-tablished. But the -principle of the plebiscite
  has been incorporated in the modern Swlss constltutlon, (under the name of â€œreferendum,")
  by whlch a revision of the con-stltutlon must be undertaken when demand-ed by the
  vote of fifty thousand Swiss citl-zens. Maine, Popular Govt 40, 96
