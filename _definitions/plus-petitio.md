body: 'In Roman law. A phrase denoting the offense of claiming more thau was just
  In one’s pleadings. Thlfc mord might be claimed in four different respects; viz.:
  (1) Re, i. e., in amount, (e. g., £50 for £5;) (2) loco, i. e.. In place, (e. g.,
  delivery at some place more difficult to efTect than the place specified;) (3) tempore,
  i. e., in time; (e. g., claiming payment on the 1st of Au-gust of what is not due
  till the 1st of September;) and (4) causa, i. e., in quality* (e. g., claiming a
  dozen of champagne, when tiie con-tract was only for a dozen of wine generally.)
  Prior to Justinian’s time, this offense was in general fatal to the action; but,
  under the legislation of the emperors Zeno and Justln-lan, the offense (if re, loco,
  or causa) exposed the party to the payment of three times the damage, if any, sustained
  by the other side, and (if tempore) obliged him to postpone his action for double
  the time, and to pay the costs of his first action before commencing a second. Brown'
