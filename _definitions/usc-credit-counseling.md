body: 'Generally refers to two events in individual bankruptcy cases: (1) the "individual
  or group briefing" from a nonprofit budget and credit counseling agency that individual
  debtors must attend prior to filing under any chapter of the Bankruptcy Code; and
  (2) the "instructional course in personal financial management" in chapters 7 and
  13 that an individual debtor must complete before a discharge is entered. There
  are exceptions to both requirements for certain categories of debtors, exigent circumstances,
  or if the U.S. trustee or bankruptcy administrator have determined that there are
  insufficient approved credit counseling agencies available to provide US Cssary
  Geling.'
