body: A government exercised by seven persons, or a natlon divided into seven governments.
  In the year 560, seven dlfferent monarchies had been formed in England by the German
  tribes, namely, that of Kent by the Jutes; those of Sussex, wes-sex, and Essex by
  the Saxons; and those of East Anglia, Bernlcia, and Deira by the An-gles. To these
  were added, about the year 586, an eighth, called the “Kingdom of Mer-cla,” also
  founded hy the Angles, nnd com-prehendlng nearly the whole of the heart of the kingdom.
  These states formed what has been designated the “Anglo-Saxon octarchy,” • or more
  commonly, though not so correctly, the “Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy," from the cus-tom
  of speaking of Delra and Bernicia under the single appellation of the “Kingdom of
  Northumberland." wharton
