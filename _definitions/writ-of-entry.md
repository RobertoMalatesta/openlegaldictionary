body: A real action to re-cover the possession of land where the ten-ant (or owner)
  bas been disseised or other-wise wrongfully dispossessed. If the disseisor has aliened
  the land, or if it has descend-ed to his heir, the writ of entry is said to be in
  the per, because it alleges that the defend-ant (the alienee or heir) obtained possession
  through the original disseisor. If two aiien-ations (or descents) have taken place,
  the writ is in the per and cui, because it alleges that the defendant (the second
  alienee) ob-tained possession through the first alienee, io whom the original disseisor
  had aliened it. If more than two alienations (or descents) have taken place, the
  writ is in the post, be-cause it simply alleges that the defendant acquired possesslon
  after the origlnal disseisin
