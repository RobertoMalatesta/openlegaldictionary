title: Plea
permalink: "/definitions/plea.html"
body: In old English law. A suit or action. Thus, the power to “hold pleas” is the
  power to take cognizance of actions or suits; so “common pleas” are actions or suits
  between private persons. And this meaning of the word still appears in the modern
  declarations, where it is stated, e. g., that the defendant “has been summoned to
  answer the plaintiff in a plea of debt.”
