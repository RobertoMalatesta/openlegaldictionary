body: In lnsurance law. To stop at a port If there be liberty granted hy the policy
  to touch, or to touch and stay, at an intermediate port on the passage, the better
  opinion now is that the Insured may trade there, when consistent with the object
  and the furtherance of the adventure, by breaking bulk, or by discharging and taking
  in cargo, provided it produces no unnecessary delay, nor enhances nor varies the
  risk. 3 Kent, Comm. 314
