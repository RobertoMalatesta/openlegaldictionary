title: Pretrial services

body: A function of the federal courts that takes place at the very start of the criminal
  justice process â€“ after a person has been arrested and charged with a federal crime
  and before he or she goes to trial. Pretrial services officers focus on investigating
  the backgrounds of these persons to help the court determine whether to release
  or detain them while they await trial. The decision is based on whether these individuals
  are likely to flee or pose a threat to the community. If the court orders release,
  a pretrial services officer supervises the person in the community until he or she
  returns to court.
