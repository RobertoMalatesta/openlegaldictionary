body: The radicnl mending of this word appears to be that of a mark, style, or designation;
  a distinctive appellation; the name by which anything is known. Thus, in the law
  of persons, a title is an appella-tion of dignity or distinction, a name denoting
  the social rank of the person bearing it as “duke” or “oount.” So, in legislation,
  the title of a statute is the heading or pre-ilminary part, furnishing the name
  by which the act is individually known. It is usually prefixed to the statute in
  the form of a brief summary of its contents; as “Au act for the prevention of gaming.”
  Again, the title of a patent is the short description of the In-vention, which is
  copied in the letters pat-ent from the Inventor's petition; e. g., “a new and improved
  method of drying and. preparing malt" Johns. Pat. Man. 90
