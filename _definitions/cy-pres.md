body: As near as [possible.] The rule of cy-prcs is a rule for the construction of
  instruments in equity, by which the inteu-tion of the party ls carried out os near
  as mag be, when it would be impossible or ille-gal to give it literal efTect. Thus,
  where a testator attempts to create a perpetuity, the court will endeavor, Instead
  of making tbe devise entirely void, to explain the will in such a way as to carry
  out the testator's gen-eral Intention as far as the rule against per-petuitles wlll
  allow. So ln the case of be-quests to charitable uses; aud particularly where the
  language used ls so vague or un-certalu that the testatorâ€™s design must be sought
  by construction. See 6 Cruise, Dig. 165; 1 Spence, Eq. Jur. 532; Taylor v. Keep,
  2 111. App. 383; Beekman v. Bonsor. 23 N. Y. 308, 80 Am. Dec. 269; Jackson v. Brown,
  13 wend. (N. Y.) 445; Doyle v. whalen, 87
