body: TS. This expression ls applied by Hallam (Const Hist. c. 13) to acts of parliament
  for the restraint of printing, except by license. It may also be ap-plied to any
  act of parliament passed for the purpose of requiring a license for doing any act
  whatever. But, generally, when we speak of the licensing acts, we mean the acts
  regulating the sale of intoxicating liquors. Mosley & whltley
