body: If the plalntlff in a plaint in the mayor’s court of London has attached property
  belonging to the defendant and ob-tained execution against the garnishee, the defendant,
  if he wishes to contest the plain-tiff’s claim, and obtain restoration of his property,
  must issue a scire facias ad dis-prob an dum debitum; lf the only question to be
  tried is the plaintiff's debt, the plaintiff in appearing to the scire facias prays
  stet billa “that his bill original," i. e., his orig-inal plaint, “may stand, and
  that the defend-ant may plead thereto.” The actlon then pro-ceeds in the usual way
  as if the proceedings in attachment (which are founded on a fictitious default of
  the defendant in appearing to the plaint) had not taken place. Brand, F. Attachm.
