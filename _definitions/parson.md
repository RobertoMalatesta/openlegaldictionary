permalink: "/definitions/parson.html"
body: The rector of a chnrch; one that has full possession of all the rights of a
  parochial church. The appellation of “parson,” however it may be depreciated by
  familiar, clownish, and indiscriminate use, is the most legal, most beneficial,
  and most honorable title that a parish priest can en-joy, because such a one, Sir
  Edward Coke observes, and he only, is eald vicem seu personam ecclesiw gcrerc. (to
  represent and bear the person of the church.) 1 Bl. Comm. 384
