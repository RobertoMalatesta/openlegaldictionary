body: This was an English court of very ancient origin, but new-modeled by St. 3 Hen.
  VII. c. 1, aud 21 Hen. VIII. c. 20, consisting of divers lords, spiritual and temporal,
  being prlvy councillors, together with two judges of the courts of common law, without
  the lnterveu-tion of any jury. The jurisdiction extended legally over riots, perjury,
  misbehavior of sheriffs, and other misdemeanors contrary to the laws of the land;
  yet It was after-wards stretched to the asserting of all proc-lamations and orders
  of state, to the vindi-cating of illegal commissions and grants of monopolies; holding
  for honorable that which it pleased, and for just that which it profited, and becoming
  both a court of law
