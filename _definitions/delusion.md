permalink: "/definitions/delusion.html"
body: In medical jurisprudence. An insane delusion is an unreasoning and in-corrigible
  belief in the existence of facts which are either impossible absolutely, or, at
  least, Impossible under the circumstances of the individual. It is never the result
  of reasoning and reflection; it is not generated by them, and it cannot be dispelled
  by them; and hence it is not to be confounded with an opinion, however fantastic
  the latter may be. Guiteauâ€™s Case (D. C.) 10 Fed. 170. See Insanity
