body: In ecclesiastical law. Those days which the ancient fathers called "quatuor
  tempora jejunii" are of great an-tiquity in the church. They are observed on wednesday,
  Friday, and Saturday next after Quadragesima Sunday, or the first Sunday in Lent,
  after whitsnntide, Holyrood Day, in September, and SL Lucy’s Day, about the middle
  of December. Brit c. 53. our alma-nacs call the weeks in which they fall the “Ember
  weeks,” and they are now chiefly noticed on account of the ordination of priests
  and deacons; because the canon appoints the Sundays next after tbe Ember weeks for
  the solemn times of ordination, though the bishops, if they please, may ordain on
  any Sun-day or holiday. Enc. Lond
