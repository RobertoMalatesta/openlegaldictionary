  the duty is laid in the form of a percentage on the value of the property; the latter
  where It is imposed as a fixed sum on each article of a class without regard to
  its value. The term ad valorem tax is as well defined and fixed as any other used
  in political economy or legislation, and sim-ply means a tax or duty upon the value
  of the article or thing subject to taxation. Bailey v. Fuqua, 24 Miss. 501; Pingree
