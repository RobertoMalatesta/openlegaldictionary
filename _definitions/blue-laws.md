title: Blue Laws
letter: B

body: A supposititious code of severe laws for the regulation of religious and personal
  conduct in the colonies of Connecticut and New Haven; hence any rigid Sunday laws
  or religious regulations. The assertion by some writers of the existence of the
  blue laws has no other basis than the adoption, by the first authorities of the
  New Haven colony,' of the Scriptures as their code of law and government, and their
  strict application of Mosaic principles. Century Dict
