title: Chamber Surveys
letter: C
permalink: "/definitions/bld-chamber-surveys.html"
body: At an early day in Pennsylvania, surveyors often made drafts on paper of pretended
  surveys of pub-lic lands, and returned them to the land office as duly surveyed,
  Instead of going on the ground and establishing lines and marking corners; and these
  false and fraudulent pre-tenses of surveys never actually made were called “chamber
  surveys.” Schraeder Min. & Mfg. Co. v. Packer, 129 U. S. 688, 9 Sup. St. 385, 32
