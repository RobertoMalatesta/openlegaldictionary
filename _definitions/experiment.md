title: Experiment
permalink: "/definitions/experiment.html"
body: In patent law, either a trial of an uncompleted mechanical structure to ascertain
  what changes or additions may be necessary to make it accomplish the design of the
  projector, or a trial of a complet-ed machine to test or illustrate its practical
  efficiency. In the former case, the inventorâ€™s efforts, being incomplete, if they
  are then abandoned, will have no effect upon the right of a subsequent inventor;
  but if the experi-ment proves the capacity of the machine to effect what its inventor
  proposed, the law assigns to him the merit of having produced a complete invention.
