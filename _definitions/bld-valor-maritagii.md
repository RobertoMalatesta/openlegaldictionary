body: Lat. Value of the marriage. In feudal law, the guardian in chivalry had the
  right of tendering to his infant ward a suitable match, without “dis-pa rage ment,”
  (inequality,) which, if the ln-fants refused, they forfeited the value of the marriage
  (valor maritagii) to thelr guardian; that is, so much as a jury would assess, or
  auy one would bona fide give, to the guardian for such an alliance. 2 Bl. Comm.
