body: In English law. Cer-taln duties which must be paid by thosu who clalm to exercise
  the elective franchlse within certain cltles and boroughs, before they are entltled
  to vote. It is said that the practlce became unlform to refer to the poor-rate as
  a register of “scot and lot” voters; so that the term, when employed to define a
  right of election, meant only the payment by a parishioner of the sum to which he
  was assessed on the poor-rate. Brown
