body: Those who adhered to the doctrine of Luther; so called because, in 1529, they
  protested against a decree of the emperor Charles V. and of the diet of Spires,
  and declared that they appealed to a general council. The name is now applied indiscrim-lnately
  to ail the sects, of whatever de-nomination, who have seceded from the Church of
  Rome. Enc. Lond. See Hale v. Everett, 53 N. H. 9, 16 Am. Rep. 82; Appeal of Tappan,
  52 Conn. 413
