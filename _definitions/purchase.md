body: The word, “purchase" is used In law in contradistinction to “descent,” and means
  any other mode of acquiring real property than by the common course of in-heritance.
  But it is also much used in its more restricted vernacular sense, (that of buying
  for a sum of money,) especially in modern law literature; and this is universally
  its application to the case of chattels. See Stamm v. Bostwick, 122 N. Y. 48, 25
  N. E. 233, 9 L. R. A. 597; Hall v. Hall, 81 N. Y. 134; Berger v. United States Steel
  Corp., 63 N. J. Eq. 809, 53 Atl. 68; Falley v. Gribling, 128 Ind. 110, 26 N. B.
