body: Socage tenure, in Eugland, is the holding of certaiu lands in consideration
  of certain inferior services of husbandry to be performed by the tenant to the lord
  of the fee. "Socage,” in its most general and ex-tensive signification, seems to
  denote a tenure by auy certain and determinate service. And in this sense it is
  by the ancient writers constantly put in opposition to tenure by chivalry or kuight-service,
  where the render was precarious and uncertain. Socage is of two sorts,—free socage,
  where the servlces are not only certain, but honorable; and vil-lein socage, where
  the services, though certain, are of baser nature. Such as hold by the former tenure
  are also called in Glanvil and other authors by the name of “liberi sokemanni,"
  or tenants in free socage. By the statute 12 Car. 2, c. 24, all the tenures by knight-service
  were, with one or two im-material exceptions, converted into free and common socage.
