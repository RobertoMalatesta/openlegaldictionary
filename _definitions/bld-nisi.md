title: Nisi
letter: N
permalink: "/definitions/bld-nisi.html"
body: Lat Unless. The word is often affixed, as a kind of elllptlcal expression, to
  the words “rule,” “order,” “decree,” “Judg-ment,” or “confirmation,” to Indlcate
  that the adjudication spoken of is one’ which is to stand as valid and operative
  unless the par-ty affected by it shall appear and show cause against it, or take
  some other appro-priate step to avoid It or procure Its revoca-tion. Thus a “decree
  nisi” is one which will definitely conclude the defendant’s rlghts unless, within
  the prescribed time, he shows cause to set it aside or successfully appeals. The
  word, in this sense, is opposed to “ab-solute." And when a rule nisi is finally
  con-firmed, for the defendant’s failure to show cause against it, it is said to
  be “made abso-lute.”
