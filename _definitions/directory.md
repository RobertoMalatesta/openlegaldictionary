body: A provision in a statute, rule of procedure, or the like, is sald to be dlrectory
  when it is to be consldered as a mere dlrection or lnstructlon of no obliga-tory
  force, and lnvolvlng no lnvalidatlng con-sequence for lts disregard,, as opposed
  to an imperative or mandatory provlsion, whlch must be followed. The general rule
  is that the prescriptions of a statute relating to the performance of a publlc duty
  are so far directory that, though neglect of them may be punlshable, yet it does
  not afTect the validity of the acts done under them, as in the vase of a statute
  requlrlng an officer to prepare and dellver a document to another officer on or
  before a certain day. Maxw. Interp. St 330, et seq. And see Pearse v. Morrice, 2
