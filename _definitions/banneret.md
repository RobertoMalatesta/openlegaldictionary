body: or BANNERET. In English law. A knight made in the field, by the ceremony of
  cutting off the point of his standard, and making it, as it were, a banner. Knights
  so made are accounted so hon-orable that they are allowed to display their arms
  in the royal army, as barons do, and may bear arms with supporters. They rank next
  to barons; und were sometimes called “vexillarii.” wharton
