body: The earliest stat-ute or code of Roman law, framed by a corn-mission of ten
  men, B. C. 450, upon the re-turn of a commission of three who had beeu sent abroad
  to study foreign laws and insti-tutions. The Twelve Tables consisted partly of laws
  transcribed from the lnstltutionB of other nations, partly of such as were altered
  and accommodated to the manners of the Romans, partly of new provlslons, and main*
  ly, perhaps, of laws and usages under thelr ancient kings. They formed the source
  and foundation for the whole later development of Roman jurisprudence. They exist
  now only in fragmentary form. See 1 Kent* Comm. 520
