body: This wofd, when used alone, will be construed to mean “due east.” But that is
  a rule of necessity growing out of the indeflniteness of the term, and has no application
  where other words are used for the purpose of qualifying its meaning, where such
  is the case, instead of meaning “due east,” it means precisely what the quali-fying
  word makes it mean. Fratt v. wood-ward, 32 Cal. 227, 91 Am. Dec. 573; Scraper v.
  Pipes, 59 Ind. 164; wiltsee v. Mill A Min. Co., 7 Ariz. 95, 60 Pac. 896
