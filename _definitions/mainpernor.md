body: In old practlce. A surety for the appearance of a person under arrest, who is
  delivered out of custody Into the hands of his ball. “Mainpernors” dif-fer from
  “ball” in that a mnn’s bail may imprison or surrender him up before the stipulated
  day of appearance; mainpernors can do neither, but are barely sureties for hls appearance
  at the day. Bail are only sureties that the party be answerable for the speclal
  matter for which they stipulate; mainpernors are bound to produce him to answer
  all charges whatsoever. 3 Bl. Comm. 128. other distinctions are made in tbe old
