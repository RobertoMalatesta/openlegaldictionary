title: State Of Facts
permalink: "/definitions/state-of-facts.html"
body: Formerly, when a master in chancery was directed by the court of chancery to
  make an inquiry or investiga-tion lnto any matter arlslng out of a suit, and which
  could not conveniently be brought before the court ltself, each party in the suit
  carried in before the master a statement showing how the party bringing it iu repre-sented
  the matter ln question to he; and this statement was technically termed a “state
  of facts,” and formed the ground upon which the evidence was received, the evidence
  be-ing, in fact, brought by one party or the other, to prove hls own or disprove
  hls op-ponent’s state of facts. And so now, a state of facts means the stntement
  made by any one of his version of the facts. Brown
