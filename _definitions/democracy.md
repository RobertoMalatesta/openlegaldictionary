body: That form of govern-ment in which the sovereign power resides in and is exercised
  by the whole body of free citizens; qs distinguished from a monarchy, aristocracy,
  or oligarchy. According to the theory of a pure democracy, every citizen should
  participate directly in the business of governing, and tbe legislative assembly
  should comprise the whole people. But the nltimate lodgment of the sovereignty being

  remove a government from this type. Hosvever, a government of tbe latter kind is
  sometimes specifically described as a "representative de-mocracy.‚Äù
