body: In Saxon law. The rate flx-ed by law at which certain injuries to.per-son or
  property were to be paid for; in in-jurles to the person, It seems to be equivalent
  to the â€œwere," i. e., the price at which every man was valued. It seems also to
  have been the fixed price at which cattle and other goods were received as currency,
  and to have been much higher than the market price, or ceapgild. wharton
