body: Among the Romans the first day of every month, being spoken of by it-self, or
  the very day of the new moon, which usually happen together. And if pridie, the
  day before, be added to it, then it is the last day of the foregoing month, as pridie
  calend. Beptemb. is the last day of August. If any number be placed wlth it, it
  signifies that day in the former month which comes so much before the month named,
  as the tenth calends of october is the 20th day of September; for if one reckons
  backwards, beginning at october, that 20th day of September makes the 10th day before
  october. In March, May, July, and october, the .calends begin at the sixteenth day,
  but in other months at the fourteenth; which calends must ever bear the name of
  the month following, and be numbered backwards from the first day of the said following
  months. Jacob. See Rives v. Guthrie, 46 N. C. 87
