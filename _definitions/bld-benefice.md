body: In ecclesiastical law. In its technical sense, this term includes ec-clesiastical
  preferments to which rank or public office is attached, otherwise describ-ed as
  ecclesiastical dignities or offices, such as bishoprics, deaneries, and the like;
  but in popular acceptation, it is almost invari-ably appropriated to rectories,
  vicarages, perpetual curacies, district churches, and endowed chapelries. 3 Steph.
