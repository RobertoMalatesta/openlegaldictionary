body: The name given by the glossators to the second of the three purts or volumes
  into which the Pandects were di-vided. The glossators at Bologna had at first only
  two parts, the first called “Digestum Vetus," (the old Digest,) pnd the last call-ed
  “Digestum Novum,” (the New Digest.) When they afterwards received the middle or
  second part, they separated from the Digestum Novum the beginning it had then, and
  added it to the second part, from which enlargement the latter received the name
