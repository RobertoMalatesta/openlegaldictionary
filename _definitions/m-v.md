body: orporations. A merger of corporations consist in the uniting of two or more
  corporations by the transfer of property of all to one of them, which continues
  in existence, the others being swallowed up or merged therein. In regard to the
  survivor-ship of one of the constituent corporations, it differs from a “consolidation,”
  wherein all the consolidating companies surrender their separate existence and become
  parts of a new corporation. Adams v. Yadoo & M. V. R. Co., 77 Miss. 194, 24 South.
