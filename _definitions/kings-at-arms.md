  a title which seems to have been exchanged for “king-at-aruis” about the reign of
  Henry IV. The kings-at-arms at present exlsting in Eugland are three,—Garter, Clarenceux,
  and Norroy, besides Lath, who is not a member of the college. Scot: land is placed
  under an officer called “Lyon Klng-at-Arms," and Ireland is the province of one
  named “Ulster.” Wharton'
