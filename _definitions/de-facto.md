body: In fact, in deed, actunlly. This phrase is used to characterize au officer,
  a government, a past action, or a state of af-fairs which exists actually and must
  be ac-cepted for all practical purposes, but which is illegal or Illegitimate. In
  this sense it is the contrary of de jure, which means rightful, legitimate, just,
  or constitutional. Thus, an officer, king, or government de facto is one who is
  in actual possession of the ofiice or supreme power, but by usurpation, or without
  respect to lawful title; while an officer, klng, or governor de jure is one who
  has just claim and rightful title to tlie office or power, but who has never had
  plenary possession of the same, or is not now in actual possession. 4 Bl. Comm.
  77, 78. So a wife de facto is one whose marriage is voidable by decree, as distinguished
  from a wife de jure, or lawful wife. 4 Kent, Comm. 36
