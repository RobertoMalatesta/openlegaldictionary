body: This term, in its natural and ordinary signification, is under-stood to be something
  greater or superior in power aud influence to others, with which it is connected
  or compared. So understood, a â€œpredominant motive," when several motives may have
  operated, is one of greater force and effect, in producing the given re-sult, than
  any other motive. Matthews v. Bliss, 22 Pick. (Mass.) 53
