letter: C
permalink: "/definitions/compile.html"
body: To compile is to copy from various authors into one work. Between a compilation
  and an abridgment there is a dear distinction. A compilation consists of selected
  extracts from different authors; an abridgment is a condensation of the views of
  one author. Story v. Holcombe, 4 McLean, 306, 314, Fed. Cas. No. 13,497
