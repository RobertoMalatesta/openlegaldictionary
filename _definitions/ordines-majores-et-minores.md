body: In ecclesiastical law. The holy orders of priest, deacon, and subdeacon, any
  of which qualified for presentation and admission to an ecclesiastical dignity or
  cure were called “ordine* majore*;" and the inferior orders of chanters, psalmists,
  ostia ry, reader, exorcist, and acolyte were called “ordine* minore*" Persons ordained
  to the ordine* minore* had their prima tonsura, different from the tonsura clericali*.
