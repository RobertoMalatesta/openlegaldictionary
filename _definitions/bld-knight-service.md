body: A species of feu-dal tenure, which differed very slightly from a pure and perfect
  feud, being entirely of a military nature; and it was the first, most universal,
  and most honorable of the feudal tenures. To make a tenure by knight-service, a
  determinate- quantity of laud was neces-sary, which was called a “knight’s fee,”
  (feodum militare,) the measure of which was estimated at 680 acres. Co. Litt. 69a;
