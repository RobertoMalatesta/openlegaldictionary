body: A release of a debtor from personal liability for certain dischargeable debts.
  Notable exceptions to dischargeability are taxes and student loans. A discharge
  releases a debtor from personal liability for certain debts known as dischargeable
  debts and prevents the creditors owed those debts from taking any action against
  the debtor or the debtor's property to collect the debts. The discharge also prohibits
  creditors from communicating with the debtor regarding the debt, including through
  telephone calls, letters, and personal contact.
