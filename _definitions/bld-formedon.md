body: 'An ancient writ in Eng-lish law which was available for one who had a right
  to lands or tenements by virtue of a gift in tall. It was in the nature of a writ
  of right, and was the highest action that a tenant in tall could have; for he conld
  not have an absolute writ of right, that being confined to such as claimed in fee-simple,
  and for that reason this writ of formedon was granted to him hy the statute de donis,
  (westm. 2,13 Edw. I. c. 1,) and was emphatically called â€œhis" writ of right. The
  writ was distinguished into three species, viz.: Formedon in the descender, in the
  re-malnder, and in the reverter. It was abolished in England by St. 3 & 4 wm. IV.
  c. 27. See 3 Bl. Comm. 191; Co. Litt. 316; Fitzh. Nat Brev. 255'
