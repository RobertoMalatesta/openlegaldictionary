body: From office; by virtue of the ofiice; without any other warrant or appointment
  than that resulting from the holding of a particular ofiice. Powers may be exercised
  by an officer which are not spe-cifically conferred upon him, but are neces-sarily
  Implied in his ofiice; these are ex offieio. Thus, a judge has ex officio the pow-ers
  of a conservator of the peace. Courts are bound to notice public statutes judicially
  and ex officio
