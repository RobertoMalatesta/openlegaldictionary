body: A public an-nouncement of an intended marriage, requir-ed by the English law
  to be made in a church or chapel, during service, on three consecutive Sundays before
  the marriage is celebrated. The object is to afford an oppor-tunity for any person
  to interpose an objec-tlon if he knows of any impediment or other just cause why
  the marringe should not take place. The publication of the bans may be dispensed
  with by procuring a special license to marry
