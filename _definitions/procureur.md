body: 'In French law. An at-torney-; one who has received a commission from another
  to act on his behalf. There were in France two classes of procureurs: Procureurs
  ad ncgotia, appointed by an individual to act for him in the administration of his
  affairs; persons invested with a power of attorney; corresponding to “attorneys
  in fact.” Procureurs ad lites were persons ap-polnted and authorized to act for
  a party in a court of Justice. These corresponded to at-torneys at law, (now called,
  in England, “solicitors of the supreme court.”) The order of procureurs was abolished
  in 1791, and that of ovouts established in their place. Mozley & whitley'
