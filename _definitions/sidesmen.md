body: In ecclesiastical law. These were originally persons whom, in the ancient episcopal
  synods, the bishops were wont to summon out of each parish to give informa-tion
  of the disorders of the clergy and people, and to report heretics. In process of
  time they became standing officers, under the title of “synodsmen,” “sidesmen,"
  or “quest-men.” The whole of thelr dutles seems now to have devolved by custom upon
  the church-wardens of a parish. 1 Burn, Ecc. Law, 399
