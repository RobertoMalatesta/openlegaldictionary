body: In French law, Certain goods pay higher export duties when exported to a foreign
  country than when they are destined for another French port. In order to prevent
  fraud, the administration compels the shipper of goods sent from one. French port
  to another to give security that such goods shall not be sent to a foreign country.
  The certificate which proves the* receipt of the security is called â€œacquit d caution*
