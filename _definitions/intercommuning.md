body: Letters of Inter-communing were letters from the Scotch privy council passing
  (on their act) in the king's name, charging the lieges not to reset, supply, or
  intercommune with the persons thereby denounced; or to furnish them with meat, drink,
  house, harbor, or any other thing useful or comfortable; or to have any inter-course
  with them whatever,â€”under pain of being reputed art and part in their crimes, and
  dealt with accordingly; and desiring all sheriffs, bailies, etc., to apprehend and
  commit such rebels to prison. Bell
