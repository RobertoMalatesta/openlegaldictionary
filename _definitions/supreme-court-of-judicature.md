body: The court formed by the English judicature act, 1873, (as modified by the judicature
  act, 1875, the appellate jurisdiction act, 1876, and the judicature acts of 1877,
  1879, and 1881,) in substitution for the various su-Iierlor courts of law, equity,
  admiralty, pro* bate, and divorce, existing when the act was passed, including the
  court of appeal in chan-cery and bankruptcy, and the exchequer chamber. It consists
  of two permanent di-vislons. viz., a court of original jurisdiction, called the
  “high court of justice," and a court of appellate jurisdiction, called the “court
  of appeal.” Its title of “supreme" is now a misnomer, ns the superior appellate
  jurisdiction of the house of lords and privy council, which was originally intended
  to be transferred to it, has been allowed to remain. Sweet
