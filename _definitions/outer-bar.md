body: In the English courts, barristers at law have been divided lnto two classes,
  viz., king’s counsel, who are admit-ted within the bar of the courts, in seats specially
  reserved for themselves, and junior counsel, who sit without the bar; and the latter
  are thence frequently termed barristera of the “outer bar,” or “utter bar.” in contradistinction
  to the former class. Brown
