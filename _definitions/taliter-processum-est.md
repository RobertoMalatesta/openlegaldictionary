body: Upon pleading the judgment of an inferior court, the proceedings preliminary
  to such judg-ment, and on which the same was founded, must, to some extent, appear
  in the plead-ing, but the rule Is that they may be alleged with a general allegation
  that “such pro-ceedings were had,” Instead of a detailed account of the proceedings
  themselves, and this general allegatlon is called the “tal iter processum est" A
  like concise mode of stat-ing former proceedings ln a . suit is adopted at the present
  day in chancery proceedings upon petitions and ln actions in the nature of bills
  of revivor and supplement. Brown
