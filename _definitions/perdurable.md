permalink: "/definitions/perdurable.html"
body: As applied to an estate, perdurable signifies lasting long or forever. Thus,
  a disseisor or tenant in fee upon con-dltion has as high and great an estate as
  the rightful owner or tenant in fee-simple absolute, but not so perdurable. The
  term is chiefly used with reference to the extinguish-ment of rights by unity of
  seisin, which does hot take place unless both the right and the land out of which
  it issues are held for equal* ly high and perdurable estates. Co. Lltt. 313a, 313b;
