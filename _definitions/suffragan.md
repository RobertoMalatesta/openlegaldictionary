body: Bishops who In former times were appointcd to supply the place of others during
  their absence on embassies or other business were so termed. They were' consecrated
  as other bishops were, and were anciently called “chore piscftpi” or “bishops of
  the county," in contradistinction to the regular bishops of the city or see. The
  practice of creating suffragan bishops, after hav-ing long been discontinued, wns
  recently revived ; aud such bishops are now permanent-ly “assistant” to the bishops.
