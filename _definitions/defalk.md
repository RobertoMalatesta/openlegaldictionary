title: Defalk
permalink: "/definitions/defalk.html"
body: LK. To set off one clalm against another; to deduct a debt due to one from a
  debt which one owes. Johnson v. Signal Co., 57 N. J. Eq. 79, 40 Atl. 193; Pepper
  v. warren, 2 Marv. (Del.) 225, 43 Ath 91. This verb corresponds only to the second
  meaning of “defalcation” as given above; a public officer or trustee who misappropriates
  or embezzles funds in his hands is not said to "defalk.”
