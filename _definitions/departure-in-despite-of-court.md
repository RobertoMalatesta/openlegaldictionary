title: Departure In Despite Of Court
permalink: "/definitions/departure-in-despite-of-court.html"
body: In old English practice. The ten-ant in a real action, having once appeared,
  was considered as constructively present in court until again called upon. Hence
  if, up-on being demanded, he failed to appear, he was sald to have “departed in
  despite [i. e., contempt] of the court.”
