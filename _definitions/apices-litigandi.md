permalink: "/definitions/apices-litigandi.html"
body: Extremely fine points, or subtleties of litigation. Nearly equivalent to the
  modem phrase “sharp prac-tice.” “It is unconscionable in a defendant to take advantage
  of the apices litigandi, to turn a plaintiff around nnd make him pay costs when
  his demand is just.” Per Lord Mansfield, in 3 Burr. 1243
