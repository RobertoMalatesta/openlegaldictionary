body: The system which the feudal tenants introduced of granting smaller estates out
  of those whlch they held of thelr lord, to be held of themselves as inferior lords.
  As this system was proceed-lng downward ad infinitum, and depriving the lords of
  their feudal profits, it was en-tirely suppressed by the statute Quia Emp-tores,
  18 Edw. I. c. 1., and Instead of it al-ienatlon in the modern sense was introduced,
  so that thenceforth the alienee held of the same chief lord and by the same services
  that hls alienor before him held. Brown
