body: 'Laws promulgated, i. e., enacted, by the Roman Emperor. They were of various
  kinds, namely, the fol-lowing: (l) Edicta; (2) decreta; (3) rescripts, called also,
  "epistol#." Sometimes they were general, and intended to form a precedent for other
  like cases; at other times they were special, particular, or individual, (personates.)
  and not lntended to form a prec-edent. The emperor had this power of irresponsible
  enactment by virtue of a certain lex regia, whereby he was made the fountain of
  Justice and of mercy. Brown.'
