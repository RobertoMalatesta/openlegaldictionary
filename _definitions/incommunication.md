  be subjected to this treatment unless it he expressly ordered by the judge, for
  some grave offense, and it cannot be continued for a longer period than is absolutely
  necessary. This precaution is re-sorted to for the purpose of preventing the accused
  from knowing beforehand the testimony of the witnesses, or from attempting to corrupt
  them and concert such measures ' as will efface the traces of hls guilt. As soon,
