body: In English law. A court for the trial of cases of treason and felony. The commis-sloners
  of assise and nisi prius are judges selected by the king and appointed aud au-thorized
  under the great seal, including usually two of the Judges at westmlnster, and sent
  out twice a year Into most of the counties of England, for the trial (with a jury
  of the county) of causes then depend-lng at westmlnster, both civil and criminal.
  They sit by virtue of several commissions, each of which, in reality, constitutes
  them a separate and distinct court. The commis-sion of oyer and terminer gives them
  author-ity for the trial of treasons and felonies; that of general gaol delivery
  empowers them to try every prisoner then in gaol for what-ever offense; so that,
  altogether, they pos-sess full criminal jurisdiction
