title: Lucrativa Causa
letter: L
permalink: "/definitions/lucrativa-causa.html"
body: Lat. In Roman law. A consideration which is voluntary; that is to say, a gratuitous
  gift, or such like. It was opposed to onerosa causa, which denoted a valuable consideration.
  It was a principle of the Roman law that two lucra-tive causes could not concur
  in the same person as regarded the same thing; that is to say, that, when the same
  thing was bequeath-ed to a person by two different testators, he could not have
  the thing (or its value) twice over. Brown
