title: Tenet; Tenuit
letter: T

body: Lat. He holds; he held. In the Latin forms of the writ of waste against a tenant,
  these words intro-duced the allegation of tenure. If the ten-ancy still existed,
  and recovery of the land was sought, the former word was used, (and the writ was
  said to be “in the tenet.”) If the tenancy had already determined, the lat-ter term
  was used, (the writ being described as “in the tenuit,") and then damages only were
  sought
