body: The annulment of a law by constitutional authority. It stands opposed to rogation;
  and is distinguished from derogation, which implies the taking away only some part
  of a tow; from subrogation, which denotes the adding a clause to it; from dispensation,
  which only sets it aside in a particular instance; and from an-tiquation. which
  is the refusing to pass a law. Encyc. Lond
