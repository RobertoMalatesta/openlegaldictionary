permalink: "/definitions/dumb-bidding.html"
body: In sales at auction, when the minimum amount which the owner will take for the
  article is written on a piece of paper, and placed by the owner under a candlestick,
  or other thing, and it is agreed that no bidding shall avail unless equal to that,
  this is called “dumb-bidding.” Bab. Auct 44
