body: A boarding-house is not in common parlance, or in legal mean-ing, every private
  house where one or more boarders are kept occasionally only and upon special considerations.
  But it is a quasi pub-lie house, where boarders are generally and habitually kept,
  and which is held out and known as a place of entertainment of that kind. Cady v.
  McDowell, 1 Lans. (N. Y.) 486
