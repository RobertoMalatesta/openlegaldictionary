body: In the old process of levying a fine of lands, the concord was an agreement
  between the parties (real or feign-ed) in which the deforciant (or he who keeps
  the other out of possession} acknowledges that the lands in question are the right
  of complainant; and, from the acknowledgment or admission of right thus made, the
  party who levies the fine is called the “cognizor,” and the person to whom it is
  levied the “cognizee.” 2 Bl. Comm. 350
