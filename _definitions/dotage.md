body: Dotage is that feebleness of the mental faculties -which proceeds from old age.
  It is a diminution or decay of that in-tellectual power which was once possessed.
  It is the slow approach of death; of that irrevocable cessation, without hurt or
  dis-ease, of all the functions which once be-longed to the living animal. The external
  functions gradually cease; the senses waste away hy degrees; and the mind is imper-ceptibly
  visited by decay, owingâ€™s Case, 1 Bland (Md.) 389, 17 Am. Dec. 311
