permalink: "/definitions/uniformity.html"
body: In taxation. Uniform-lty in taxation implies equality in the bur-den of taxation,
  which cannot exist without uniformity in the mode of assessment, as well as in the
  rate of taxation. Further, the uniformity must be coextensive with the ter-ritory
  to which it applies. And it must be extended to all property subject to taxation,
  so that all property may be taxed alike and equally. Exchange Bank v. Hines, 3 ohio
  St. 15. And see Edye v. Robertson, 112 U
