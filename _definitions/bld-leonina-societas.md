title: Leonina Societas
letter: L
permalink: "/definitions/bld-leonina-societas.html"
body: Lat. An at-tempted partnership, in which one party was to bear all the losses,
  and have no share in the profits. This was a void partnership in Roman law; and,
  apparently, it would also be void as a partnership in English law, as being inherently
  inconsistent with the notion of partnership. (Dig. 17, 2, 29, 2.) Brown
