title: Habitancy
permalink: "/definitions/habitancy.html"
body: Settled dwelling in a given place; fixed and permanent residence there. This
  term is more cpmprehenslve than “domicile,” for one may he domiciled in a given
  place though he does not spend the greater portion of hls time there, or though
  he may be absent for long periods. It is also more comprehensive than “residence,”
  for one mny reslde in a given place only tem-porarlly or for short periods on the
  occasion of repeated visits. Bnt in neither case could he properly be called an
  “inhabitant” of that place or be said to have hls “habitancy” there. See Atkinson
  v. washington & Jef-ferson College, 54 W. Va. 32, 46 S. B. 253; Hairston v. Hairston,
  27 Miss. 711, 61 Am. Dec. 530; Abington v. North Bridgewater, 23 Pick. (Mass.) 170.
