body: Thls name was applied in Scot-land, A. D. 1648, to those violent Covenant-era
  who opposed the Duke of Hamilton’s ln-vasion of England in order to restore Charles
  I. The appellatlon of “whig" and “Tory” to political factions was first heard of
  in A. D. 1679, and, though as senseless as any cant terms that could be devised,
  they became In-stantly as familiar in use as they have since continued. 2 Halk Const
