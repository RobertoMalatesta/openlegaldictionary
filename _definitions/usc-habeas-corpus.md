body: Latin, meaning "you have the body." A writ of habeas corpus generally is a judicial
  order forcing law enforcement authorities to produce a prisoner they are holding,
  and to justify the prisoner's continued confinement. Federal judges receive petitions
  for a writ of habeas corpus from state prison inmates who say their state prosecutions
  violated federally protected rights in some way.
