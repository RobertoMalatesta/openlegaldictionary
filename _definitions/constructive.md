body: That which is established by the mind of the law in its act of construing facts,
  conduct, circumstances, or instruments; that which has not the char-acter assigned
  to it in its own essential na-ture, but acquires such character in consequence of
  the way in which it is regarded by a rule or policy of law; hence, inferred, im-plled,
  made out by legal interpretation. Middleton V. Parke, 3 App. D. O. 160
