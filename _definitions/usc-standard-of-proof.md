body: Degree of proof required. In criminal cases, prosecutors must prove a defendant's
  guilt "beyond a reasonable doubt." The majority of civil lawsuits require proof
  "by a preponderance of the evidence" (50 percent plus), but in some the standard
  is higher and requires "clear and convincing" proof.
