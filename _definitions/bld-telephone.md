body: In a general sense, the name “telephone" applies to any instrument or apparatus
  which transmits sound beyond the limits of ordinary audibility. But, since the recent
  discoveries in telephony, the name is technically and primarily restricted to an
  Instrument or device which transmits sound hy means of electricity and wires similar
  to telegraphic wires. In a secondary sense, however, being the sense in which it
  is most commonly understood, the word "telephone” constitutes a generic term, having
  reference generally to the art of telephony as an insti-tutlon, but more particularly
  to the appara-tus, as an entirety, ordinarily used in the transmission, as well
  as in the reception, of telephonic messages. IIockett v. State, 105 Ind. 261, 5
