  it all jurisdiction then exerclsable by any ecclesiastical court in England, in
  matters matrimonial, and also gave it new powers. Tbe court consisted of the lord
  chancellor, the three chiefs, and three senior puisne judges of the common-law courts,
  and the judge ordinary, who together constltuted, and still constitute, the “full
