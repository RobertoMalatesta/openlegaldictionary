body: Formak-lng repairs. The name of an old writ which lay ln various cases; as if,
  for instance,-there were three tenants ln common of a mill or house which had fallen
  into decay, and one of the three was willing to repair it, and tbe other two not;
  in such case the party who was willing to repair might have this writ against the
  others. Cowell; Fitzh. Nat Brev. 127
