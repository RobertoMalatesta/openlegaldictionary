body: A subtle endeavoring to set aside truth or to escape the punishment of the law.
  This wlll not be allowed. If one person says to another that he will not strike
  him, but wlll glve him a pot of ale to strike first, and, accordingly, the latter
  strikes, the returning the blow is punishable; and, if the person first striking
  is killed, it is murder, for no man shall evade the justice of the law by such a
  pretense. 1 Hawk. P. C. 81. So no one may plead ignorance of the law to evade it
