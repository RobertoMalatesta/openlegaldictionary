title: Slay
permalink: "/definitions/slay.html"
body: This word, in an indictment, adds nothing to the force and effect of the word
  ‘•kill,” when used with reference to the tak-ing of human life. It is particularly
  appii-cable to the taking of human life in battle; and, when it is not used in this
  sense, it is synonymous with “kilh” State v. Thomas, 82 La. Ann. 85L
