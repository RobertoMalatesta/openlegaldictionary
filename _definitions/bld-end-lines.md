permalink: "/definitions/bld-end-lines.html"
body: In mining law, the end lines of a claim, as platted or laid down on the ground,
  are those which mark its bound-aries on the shorter dimension, where it crosses
  the vein, while the “side lines” are those which mark its longer dimension, where
  it follows the course of the vein. But with reference to extra-lateral rights, lf
  the claim as a whole crosses the vein, in-stead of following Its course, the end
  lines will become side lines and vice versa. Con-solidated wyomlug Gold Min. Co.
