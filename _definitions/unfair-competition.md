body: A term which may be applied generally to all dls-honest or fraudulent rivalry
  in trade and commerce, but is particularly applied in the courts of equity (where
  it may be restrained by injunction) to the practice of endeavoring to substitute
  one's own goods or products in the markets for those of another, having an established
  refutation and extensive sale, hy means of imitating or counterfeiting the name,
  title, size, shape, or distinctive pe-culiarltiea of the article, or the shape,
  color, label, wrapper, or general appearance of the package, or other such simulations,
  the Imitation being carried far enough to inlslead the general public or deceive
  an unwary purchaser, and yet not amounting to an absolute counterfeit or to the
  in-frlngement of a trade-mark or trade-name. Called In France nnd Germany “concurrence
  deloyale.” See Reddnwny v. Bau-ham. [18961 App. Caa. 199; Singer Mfg. Co. ▼. June
  Mfg. Co.. 163 U. 8. 169, 16 Sup. Ct
