body: In mining law, the side lines of a mining claim are those which measure the
  extent of the claim on each side of the middle of the vein at the surface. They
  are not necessarily the side lines as laid down on the ground or on a tnap or plat;
  for if the claim, In its longer dimen-siou, crosses the vein, Instead of following
  lt, the platted side lines will be treated in law as the end lines, and vice versa,
