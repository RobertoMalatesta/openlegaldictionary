title: Fifteenths
permalink: "/definitions/fifteenths.html"
body: In English law. This was originally a tax or tribute, levied at ln-tervals by
  act of parliament, consisting of one-fifteenth of all the movable property of the
  subject or personalty in every city, town-ship, nnd borough. Under Edward III.,
  the taxable property was assessed, and the value of its fifteenth part (then about
  £29,000) was recorded in the exchequer, whence the tax, levied dn that valuation,
  continued to be called a “fifteenth,” although, as the wealth of the kingdom increased,
  the name ceased to be an accurate designation of the propor-tion of the tax to the
  value taxed. See 1 Bl. Comm. 309
