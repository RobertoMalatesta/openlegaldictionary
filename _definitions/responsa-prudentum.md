body: Lat Answers of jurists; responses given upon cases or questions of law referred
  to them, by cer-tain learned Roman jurists, who, though not magistrates, were authorized
  to render such opinions. These responsa constituted one of the most important sources
  of the earlier Roman law, and were of great value in de-veloping its scientific
  accuracy. They held much the same place of authority as our modern precedents and
  reports
