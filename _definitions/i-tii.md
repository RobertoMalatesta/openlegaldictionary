body: erangement is accompanied with more or less of excitement. Sometimes the excitement
  amounts to a fury. The individual in such cases is subject to hallucinations and
  illusions. He is impressed with the reality of events which have never occurred,
  and of things which do not exist, and acts more or less in conformity with his belief
  in these particulars. The mania may be general, and affect all or most of the op-era
  tions of the mind; or it may be partial, and be confined to particular subjects.
  In tbe latter case it is generally termed 'monomania.'** In a more popular but less
  scientific sense, “mania” denotes a morbid or unnatural or ex-cessive craving, issuing
  in impulses of such fix-ity and intensity that they cannot be resisted by the patient
  in the enfeebled state of the will and blurred moral concepts which accompany the
  disease. It is used in this sense in such compounds as “homicidal mania,” “dipsomania,"
  and the like.—Hypomania. A mild or slight-ly developed form or type of mania.—Mono-mania.
  A perversion or derangement of tbe reason or understanding with reference to a single
  subject or small claas of subjects, with considerable mental excitement and delusions,^
  while, as to all matters outs'de the range of the' peculiar infirmity, the intellectual
  faculties remain unimpaired and function normal y. Hopps v. People, 31 111. 390,

  re Gannon’s will, 2 Misc. Rep. 329, 21 N. Y. Supp. 960.—Paranoia. Monomania in general,
  or the obsession of a delusion or sys-tem of delusions which dominate without de-stroying
  the mental capacity, leaving the patient sane as to all matters outside tbeir particular
  range, though subject to perverted ideas, false beliefs, and uncontrollable impulses
  within that range; and particularly, the form of monomania where the delusion is
  as to wrongs, injuries, or persecution inflicted upon the patient and his consequently
  justifiable resentment cr r^venee. winters v. State, 61 N. J. Law, 613, 41 Atl.

  30 S. E. 650. Paranoia is called by Kraepelin “progres-sive systematized insanity,”
  because the delusions of being wronged or of persecution and of excessive self-esteem
  develop quite slowly, without independent disturbances of emotional life or of tbe
  will becoming prominent, and because there occurs regularly a mental working up
  of the delusion to form a delusionary view of the world,—in fact, a system,—leading
  to a derangement of tbe stand-point which the patient takes up towards the events
  of life.—Homicidal mania. A form of mania in which the morbid state of the mind
  manifests itself in an irresist-able inclination or impulse to commit homicide,
  prompted usually by an insane delusion either as to the necessity of self-defense
  or the avenging of injuries, or as to tbe patient being the appointed instrument
  of a superhuman justice. Com. v. Sayre, 5 wkly. Notes Cas. (Pa.) 425; Com. v. Mosier,
  4 Pa. 266.—Methomania. An irre-sistible craving for alcoholic or other intoxicating
  liquors, manifested by the periodical re-currence of drunken debauches. State v.
  Savage, 89 Ala. 1, 7 South. 183, 7 L. R. A. 42B —Dipsomania. Practically the same
  thing as metho-mania, except that the irresistible impulse to intoxication is extended
  by some writers to in-clude the use of such drugs as opium or cocaine as well as
  alcohol. See State v. Reidell, 9 Houat. (Del.) 470, 14 Atl. 550; Ballard v. State,
  19 Neb. 609, 28 N. W. 271.—Mania a potn. Delirium tremens, or a species of tem-porary
