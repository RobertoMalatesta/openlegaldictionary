body: 'or USUCAPTIO. A term of Roman law used to denote a mode of ac-qulsition of
  property. It corresponds very nearly to the term “prescription.” But the prescription
  of Roman law differed from that of the English law, in thls: that no mala fide possessor
  (i. e., person in possession knowingly of the property of another) could, by however
  long a period, acquire title by possesslon merely. The two essential requlsites
  to usucapio were justa causa (i. e., title) and bona fides, (i. e., lgnorance.)
  The term “usucapio” is sometimes, hut erroneous-ly, wrltten “usucaptio” Brown. See
