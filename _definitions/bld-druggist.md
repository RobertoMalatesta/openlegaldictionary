title: Druggist

permalink: "/definitions/bld-druggist.html"
body: A dealer in drugs; one whose business is to sell drugs and medl-cines. In strict
  usage, this term is to be distinguished from “apothecary.” A drug-gist deals in
  the uncompounded medicinal substances; the business of an apothecary is to mix and
  compound them. But in America the two words are used interchangeably, as the same
  persons usually discharge both functions. State v. Holmes, 28 La. Ann. 767, 26 Am.
  Rep. 110; Hainline v. Com., 13 Bush (Ky.) 352; State v. Donaldson, 41 Minn. 74,
