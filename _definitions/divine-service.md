body: 'Divine service was the name of a feudal tenure, by which the tenants were obliged
  to do some special divine services in certaiu ; as to sing so many masses, to distribute
  such a sum in alms, and the like. (2 Bl. Comm. 102; 1 Steph. Comm. 227.) it differed
  from tenure iu frankalmoign, iu this: that, iu case of the tenure hy diviue service,
  the lord of whom the lauds were holden might distrain for its non-perforniauce,
  whereas, in case of frankalmoign, the lord has no remedy hy distraint for neglect
  of the service, but merely a right of complttint to the visitor to correct it. Mozley
