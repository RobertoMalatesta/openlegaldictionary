permalink: "/definitions/mobbing-and-rioting.html"
body: In Scotch law. A general term including all those convocations of the lieges
  for violent and un-lawful purposes, which are attended with In-Jury to the persons
  or property of the lieges, or terror and alarm to tbe neighborhood in which it takes
  place. The two phrases are usually placed together; but, nevertheless, they have
  distinct meanings, and are some-times used separately in legal language, the word
  “mobbing” being peculiarly applicable to the unlawful assemblage nud violence of
  a number of persons, and that of “rioting” to the outrageous behavior of a single
  individual. Alls. Crim. Law, c. 23, p. 509
