body: The status of a person is hls legal position or condition. Thus, when we say
  that the status of a woman after a decree nisi for the dissolution of her marriage
  with her husband has been made, bnt before it has been made absolute, is that of
  a married woman, we mean that she has the same legal rights, liabilities, and disabilities
  as an ordi* nary married woman. The term is chiefly applied to persons under disability,
  or persons who have some peculiar condition which prevents the general law from
  applying to them in the same way as it does to ordlnary persons. Sweet See Barney
