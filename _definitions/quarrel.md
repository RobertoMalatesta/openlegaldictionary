permalink: "/definitions/quarrel.html"
body: This word is said to extend not only to real and personal actions, hut also
  to the causes of actions and suits; so that by the release of all “quarrels," not
  only actions pending, but also causes of action and suit, are released; and “quarrels,”
  “con-troversies,” and "debates” are in law con-sidered as having the same meaning.
