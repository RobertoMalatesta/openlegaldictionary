body: Although the words "show" and “indicate" are sometimes interchangeable in popular
  use, they are not always so. To “show" is to make apparent or clear by evi-dence;
  to prove; while an “lndlcation" may be merely a symptom; that which points to or
  gives dlrectlon to the mind. Coyle ▼. Com., 104 Pa. 133
