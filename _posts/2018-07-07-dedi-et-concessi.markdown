I have given and granted. The operative words of conveyance in ancient charters of feoffment, and deeds of gift and grant; the English â€œgiven and granted" being still the most proper, though not the essential, words by which such con-veyances are made. 2 Bl. Comm. 53, 316, 317; 1 Steph. Comm. 164, 177, 473, 474
