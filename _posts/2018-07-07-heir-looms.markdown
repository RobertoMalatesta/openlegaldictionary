Such goods and chat-tels as, contrary to the nature of chattels, shall go hy special custom to the heir along with the inheritance, and not to the ex-ecutor. The termination â€œloom" (Sax.) sig-niflee a limb or member; so that an heir-loom ls nothlng else but a limb or member of the inheritance. They are generally such thlngs as cannot be taken away wlthout damaging or dismembering the freehold; such as deer ln a park, doves ln a cote, deeds and charters, etc. 2 Bl. Comm. 427
