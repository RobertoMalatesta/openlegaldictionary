A recovery was effected by the party wishing te couvey the land suffering a fictitious actlon to be brought agaiust hlm by the party to whom the laud was to be conveyed, (the de-mandant,) and allowing the demandant to recover a judgment against him for the land in question. The vendor, or conveying par-ty, in thus assisting or permitting the de-mandant so to recover a judgment against him, was thence technically said to â€œsuffer a recovery." Brown
