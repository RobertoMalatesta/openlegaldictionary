ln the manor of Bradford, in wilts, the tenants pay to their lord a small yearly rent by this name, whicli is said to be for liberty to feed their hogs with the masts of the lord's wood, the fat of a hog being called “lard;” or it may be a commutation for some customary service of carrying salt or meat to the lord’s larder. Mon. Angl. t. 1, p. 321
