Lat often; frequently, when an original and alias writ have been issued and proved ineffectual, a third writ, called a “pluries writ,” may frequently.be issued. It is to the same effect as the two former, except that lt contains the words, “as we have often commanded you,” (“stout plurtos pracepimus") after the usual com-mencement, “we command you.” 8 Bl. Comm. 283; Archb. Pr. 585.
