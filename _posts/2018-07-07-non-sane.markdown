As “sane,” when applied to the mind, means whole, sound, in a bealth-ful state, “non-sane" must mean not whole, not sound, not ln a healthful state; that ls, broken, impaired, shattered, infirm, weak, diseased, unable, either from nature or acd-dent, to perform the rational functions com-mon to man upon the objects presented to it. Den v. Vancleve, 5 N. J. Law, 589, 661
