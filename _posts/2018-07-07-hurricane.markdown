A storm of great violence or intensity, of which the particular characteristic is the high velocity of the wind. There ls naturally no exact measure to distinguish between an ordinary storm and a hurricane, bnt the wind should reach a velocity of at least 50 or 60 miles an hour to be called by the latter name, or, os expressed in some of the cases, lt should be sufficient to “throw down buildings.” A hurricane is properly a circular storm in the nature of a cyclone. See Pelican Ins. Cb. v. Troy Co-op. Ass'n, 77 Tex. 225, 13 S. W. 980; Queen Ins. Co. v. Hudnut Co., 8 Ind. App. 22, 35 N. B. 397; Tyson v. Union Mut Fire A Storm Co., 2 Montg. Co. Law Rep’r (Pa.) 17
