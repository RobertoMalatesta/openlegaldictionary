In English law. A writ used ln sending a record or its tenor from one court to another. Thus, where a nul tiei record is pleaded in one court to the record of another court of equal or superior jurisdic-tion, the tenor of the record is brought into chancery by a certiorari, (q. v.,) and thence sent by mittimus into the court where the action is. Tidd, Pr. 745
