City servitudes, or servitudes of houses, are called "urban.” They are the easements appertaining to the building and construction of houses; as, for instance, the right to light and air, or the right to build a house so as to throw the rain-water on a neighbor’s house. Mosley & whitley; Civ. Code La. 1900, § 711
