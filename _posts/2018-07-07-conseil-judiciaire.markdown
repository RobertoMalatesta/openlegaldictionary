In French law. when a person has been subjected to an Interdiction on the ground of his insane extravagance, but the interdiction is not ab-solute, but limited only, the court of first instance, which grants the interdiction, ap-points a council, called hy this name, with whose assistance the party may bring or de-fend actions, or compromise the same, alien-ate his estate, make or incur loans, and the like.
