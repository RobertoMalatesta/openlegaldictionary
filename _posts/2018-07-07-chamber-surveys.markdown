At an early day in Pennsylvania, surveyors often made drafts on paper of pretended surveys of pub-lic lands, and returned them to the land office as duly surveyed, Instead of going on the ground and establishing lines and marking corners; and these false and fraudulent pre-tenses of surveys never actually made were called “chamber surveys.” Schraeder Min. & Mfg. Co. v. Packer, 129 U. S. 688, 9 Sup. St. 385, 32 L. Ed. 760
