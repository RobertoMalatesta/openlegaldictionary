Men contract debts; they incur liabilities. In the one case, they act attirma-tlvely; in the other, the liability is incurred or cast npon them by act or operation of law. “Incur” means something beyond contracts, —something not embraced in the word “debts.” Crandall v. Bryan, 5 Abb. Prac. (N. Y.) 169; Beekman v. Van Dolsen, 70 Hun, 288, 24 N. Y. Supp. 414; Ashe v. Young, 68 Tex. 123, 3 S. W. 454
