TS. This expression ls applied by Hallam (Const Hist. c. 13) to acts of parliament for the restraint of printing, except by license. It may also be ap-plied to any act of parliament passed for the purpose of requiring a license for doing any act whatever. But, generally, when we speak of the licensing acts, we mean the acts regulating the sale of intoxicating liquors. Mosley & whltley
