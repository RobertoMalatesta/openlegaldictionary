In the civil law. A future right; an Inchoate, indplpnt, or ex-pectant right, not yet fully vested. It may be either "jus delatum," when the subse-quent acquisition or vesting of it depends merely on the will of the person in whom it ls to vest, or â€œjus nondum delatum," when it depends on the future occurrence of other circumstances or conditions. Mackeld. Rom. Law, S 191
