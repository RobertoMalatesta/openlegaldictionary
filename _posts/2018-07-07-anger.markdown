A strong passion of the mind excited by real or supposed injuries; not synonymous with “heat of passion,” “malice,” or “rage or resentment,” because these are all terms of wider lmport and may lnclude anger as an element or as an incipient stage. Chandler v. State, 141 Ind. 106, 39 N. E. 444; Hoffman v. State, 97 wis. 571, 73 N. W. 51; Fanes v. State, 10 Tex. App. 421, 446
