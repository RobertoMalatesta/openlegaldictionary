In the early ages of the feud-al law, this was the name given to the grants of land made by a king or chieftain to his followers, which were held by no certain tenure, but merely at the will of the lord. Afterwards they became life-es-tates, and then hereditary, and were called first “benefices.” and then “feuds.” See wright, Ten. 19
