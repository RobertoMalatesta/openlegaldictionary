“A marauder is defined ln the law to be ‘one wbo, while employed in the army as a soldier, commits larceny or robbery in the neighborhood of tbe camp, or while wandering away from the army? But ln the modern and metaphorical sense of the word, as now sometimes used in common speech, it seems to be applied to a class of persons who are not a part of any regular army, and are not answerable to any military discipline, but wbo are mere lawless banditti, engaged in plundering, robbery, murder, and all conceivable crimes.” Curry v. Collins, 37 Mo. 328
