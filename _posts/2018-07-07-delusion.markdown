In medical jurisprudence. An insane delusion is an unreasoning and in-corrigible belief ln the existence of facts which are either impossible absolutely, or, at least, Impossible under the circumstances of the individual. It is never the result of reasoning and reflection; it is not generated by them, and it cannot be dispelled by them; and hence it is not to be confounded with an opinion, however fantastic the latter may be. Guiteauâ€™s Case (D. C.) 10 Fed. 170. See Insanity
