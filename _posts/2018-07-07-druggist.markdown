A dealer in drugs; one whose business ls to sell drugs and medl-cines. In strict usage, this term is to be distinguished from “apothecary.” A drug-gist deals in the uncompounded medicinal substances; the business of an apothecary ls to mix and compound them. But in America the two words are used interchangeably, as the same persons usually discharge both functions. State v. Holmes, 28 La. Ann. 767, 26 Am. Rep. 110; Hainline v. Com., 13 Bush (Ky.) 352; State v. Donaldson, 41 Minn. 74, 42 N. W. 781
