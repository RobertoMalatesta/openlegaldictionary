The right to possession which may reside in one man/ while another has the actual possession, be-ing the right to enter and turn out such ac-tual occupant; e. g., the right of a disseisee. An apparent right of possession is one which may be defeated by a better; an actual right of possession, one which will stand the test against all opponents. 2 Bl. Comm. 196
