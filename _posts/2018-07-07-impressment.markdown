A power possessed by the English crown of taking persons or property to aid ln the defense of the country, with or without the consent of the persons concerned. It ls usually exercised to obtain hands for the royal ships in time of war, by taking seamen engaged in merchant vessels, (1 Bl. Comm. 420; Maud & P. Shipp. 123:) but in former times impressment of merchant ships was also practiced.
