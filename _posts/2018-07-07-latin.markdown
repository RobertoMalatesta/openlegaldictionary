The language of the ancient-Romans. There are three sorts of law Latln: (1) Good Latin, allowed by the grammarians and lawyers; (2) false or lncongruous Latin, which ln times past would abate original writs, though it would not make void any judicial writ, declaration, or plea, etc.; (3) words of art, known only to the sages of the law, and not to grammarians, called “Law-yers’ Latln.” wharton
