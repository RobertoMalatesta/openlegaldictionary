In Roman law. The rule which is commonly expressed ln the maxim, Quod ab initio non valet tractu temporis non convalebit, meaning that what is at the beginning void by reason of some technical (or other) legal defect will not become valid merely by length of time. The rule applied to the institution of /itrredes, the bequest of legacies, and such like. The rule is not without Its application also in En-glish law; e. g., a marrled womanâ€™s will (be-ing void when made) ls not made valid mere-ly because she lives to become a widow. Brown
