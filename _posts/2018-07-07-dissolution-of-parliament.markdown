The crown may dissolve parliament either in person or by proclamation; the dissolution is usually by proclamation, after a prorogation. No parliament may last for a longer period than seven years. Septennial Act, 1 Geo. I. c. 38. Under 6 Anne, c. 37, upon a demise of the crown, parliament became ipso facto dissolved six months afterwards, but under the Reform Act, 1867, its continuance is now nowise affected by such demise. May, Pari. Pr. (6th Ed.) 48. Brown.
