In it the plaintiff suggests that he is the king’s debtor, and that the defendant has done him the Injury or damage complained of, quo minus sufflcienS existit, by which he is less able to pay the king’s debt This was originally requisite in order to give Jurisdiction to the court of ex-chequer; but now this suggestion is a mere form. 3 Bl.
