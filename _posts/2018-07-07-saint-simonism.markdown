An elaborate form of non-communistic socialism. It is a scheme which does not contemplate an equal, but an unequal, division of tlie produce. It does not propose that all should be occupied alike, but differently, according to their vocation or capncity; the function of each being as-signed, like grades in a regiment, by the choice of the directing authority, and the remuneration being by salary, proportioned to the importance, in the eyes of that au-thority, of the function itself, and the merits of the person tvho fulfills it 1 Mill, Pol. Econ. 258
