In Eng-llsh ecclesiastical law. A species of plead-ing, where the defendant, instead of denying the plaintiff’s charge upon oath, has any cir-cumstances to offer ln hls defense. This en-titles him, in his turn, to the plaintiff’s an-swer upon oath, upon which he mny proceed to proofs as well as his antagonist. 3 Bl. Comm. 100; 3 Steph. Comm. 720
