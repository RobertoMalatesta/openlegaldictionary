This term is sometimes used, by metonymy, to denote a time or season in the judicial year when motions may be made and rules taken, as special terms or argument-days, or even the vacations, as distinguished • from the regular terms of the courts for the trlal of causes; and, by a further extension of its meaning, it may denote proceedings in an action taken out of court Thus, “an Irregularity committed at rules may be corrected at the next term of the court" South-all’s Adm’r v. Exchange Bank, 12 Grat. (Va.) 312
