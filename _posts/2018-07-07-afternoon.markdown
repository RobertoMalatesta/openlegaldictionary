This word has two senses, it may mean the whole time from noon to midnight; or it may mean the earlier part of that time, as distinguished from the evening. When used in a statute its meaning must be determined by the con-text and the circumstances of the subject-matter. Reg. v. Knapp, 2 El. & Bl. 451
