The existence of a person in a particular place at a given time, partic-ularly with reference to some act done there and then. Besides actual presence, the law recognizes constructive presence, which iat-ter may be predicated of a persou who, though not on the very spot, was near enough to be accounted present by the law, or who was actively co-operating with another who. was actually present. See Mltchell v. Com., 33 Grat. (Va.) 868.
