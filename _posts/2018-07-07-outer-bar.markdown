In the English courts, barristers at law have been divided lnto two classes, viz., king’s counsel, who are admit-ted within the bar of the courts, in seats specially reserved for themselves, and junior counsel, who sit without the bar; and the latter are thence frequently termed barristera of the “outer bar,” or “utter bar.” in contradistinction to the former class.
