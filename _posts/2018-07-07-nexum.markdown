Lat. In Roman law. In an-cient tlmes the neaeum seems to have been a species of formal contract, involving a loan of money, and attended wlth peculiar conse-quences, solemnized wlth the “copper and bal-ance.” Later, lt appears to have been used as a general term for any contract struck wlth those ceremonies, and hence to have Included the special form of conveyance called “mancipatio” In a general sense it means the obligation or bond between contracting parties. See Maine, Anc. Law, 305, et seq.; Hadl. Rom. Law, 247
