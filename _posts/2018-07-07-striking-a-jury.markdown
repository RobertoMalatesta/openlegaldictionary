The selecting or nominating a jury of twelve men out of the whole number returned as jurors on the panel. It is especially used of the selection of a special jury, where a panel of forty-eight is prepared by the proper ofiicer, and the parties, in turn, strike off a certain number of names, until the list is reduced to twelve. A Jury thus chosen is called a “struck jury.”
