Lat In manner and form, words used in the old Latln forms of pleadings by way of traverse, and literally translated in the modern precedents, importing that the party traversing denies the allegation of the other party, not only ln its general effect, but in the exact manner and form in which it is made. Steph. PL 189, 190
