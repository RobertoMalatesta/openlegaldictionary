Damages which “nat-urally” arise from a breach of. contract are such as arise in the usual course of things, from the breach itself, or such as may rea-sonably be supposed to have been contem-piated by tbe parties when making the contract as the probable result of the breach. Mitchell v. Clarke, 71 Cal. 164, 11 Pac. 882, 60 Am. Rep. 529
