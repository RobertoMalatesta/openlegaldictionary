A copy of the Pandects discovered .accidentally about the year 1137, at Amalphl, a town in Italy, near Salerno. From Amalphl, the copy fonnd its way to Pisa, and, Pisa having sub-mltted to the Florentines in 1406, the copy was removed in great triumph to Florence. By direction of the magistrates of the town, it was immediately bound ln a superb man-ner, and deposited in a costly chest. For-merly, these Pandects were shown only by torch-light, in the presence of two magis-trates, and two Cistercian monks, with their heads uncovered. They have been succes-sively collated b.v Politian, Bolognini, and Antonlus Augustinus. An exact copy of them was published in'1553 by Franciscus Taurellus. For its accuracy and beauty, this edition ranks high among the ornaments of the press. Brenchman, who collated the manuscript about 1710, refers it to the sixth century. Butl. Hor. Jur. 90, 91
