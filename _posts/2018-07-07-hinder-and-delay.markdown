To hinder and delay is to do something whlch is an attempt to defraud, rather than a successful fraud; to put some obstacle in the path, or interpose some time, unjustifiably, before the creditor can reallze what is owed out of his debtor’s property. See Walker v. Sayers, 5 Bush (Ky.) 5S2; Burdick v. Post, 12 Barb. (N. Y.) 186; Crow v. Beardsley, 68 Mo. 439; Burn-ham v. Brennan, 42 N. ¥. Super. Ct. 63
