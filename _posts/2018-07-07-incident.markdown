This word, used as a noun, denotes anything which inseparably belongs to, or is connected with, or Inherent in, an-other thing, called the "principal.‚Äù In this sense, a court-baron is incident to a manor. Also, less strictly, it denotes anything which is usually connected with another, or connected for some purposes, though not insep-arably. Thus, the right of alienation is inci-dent to an estate in fee-simple, though sepa-rable in equity. See Cromwell v. Phipps (Sur.) 1N. Y. Supp. 278; Mount Carmel Fruit Co. v. webster, 140 Cal. 183, 73 Pae 826
