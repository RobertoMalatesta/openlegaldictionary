In French Law. In a socidtd en commandite an associd en nom is one who is liable for the engagements of the undertaking to the whole extent of his property. This expression arises from the fact that the names of the associds so liable figure in the firm-name or form part of the socidtd en nom collectif. Arg. Fr. Merc. Law, 546
