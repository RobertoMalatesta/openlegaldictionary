For two lines of street railway to be “parallel,” within the meaning of a statute, it may not be necessary that the two lines should be parallel for the whole length of each or either route. Ex-act parallelism is not contemplated. Cron-in v. Highland St Ry. Co., 144 Mass. 254, 10 N. E. 833. And see East St. Louis Connecting Ry. Co. v. Jarvis, 92 Fed. 735, 34 C. C. A. 639; Louisville & N.
