Somewhat of possession, and noth-lng of right, (hut no right) A phrase used by Bracton to describe that kind of posses-slon which a person might have of a thing as a guardian, creditor, or the like; and also that kind of possession which was granted for a term of years, where nothing could be demanded but the usufruct. Bract fols. 39a. 160a
