This, the earliest code or collection of maritime laws, was formulated by the people of the island of Rhodes, who, by thelr commercial prosperity and the superiority of their navies, had ac-qulred the sovereignty of the seas. Its date ls very uncertain, but ls supposed (by Kent and others) to be about 900 B. C. Nothing of it is now extant except the article on jettison, which has been preserved in the Roman col-lections. (Dig. 14, 2, â€œLex Rhodia-de Jactu:1) Another code, under the same name, was published In more modern times, but is generally considered, by the best authorities, to be spurious. See Schomberg, Mar. Laws Rhodes, 37, 38; 3 Kent, Comm. 3, 4; Azuni, Mar. Law, 265-296
