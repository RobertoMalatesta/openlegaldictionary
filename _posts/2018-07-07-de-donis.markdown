Concerning gifts, (or more folly, de donis conditionalibus, concerning conditional gifts.) The. name of a celebrated English statute, passed in the thirteenth year of Edw. I., and constituting the first chapter of the statute of westm. 2, by virtue of which estates in fee-simple conditional (formerly known as "dona condittonalia‚Äù) were converted into estates in fee-tail, and which, by rendering such estates inalienable, introduced perpetuities, and so strengthened the power of the nobles. See 2 Bl. Comm. 112
