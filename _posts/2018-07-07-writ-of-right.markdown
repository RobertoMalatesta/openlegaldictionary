This was a writ which lay for oue who had the rlght of property, against another who had the right of possession and the actual occupation. The writ properly lay only to recover corporeal hereditaments for an estate in fee-simple; but there were other writs, said to be “in the nature of a writ of right,” available for the recovery of incorporeal hereditaments or of lands for a less estate than a fee-simple.
