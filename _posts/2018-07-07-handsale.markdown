Anciently, among all tbe northern nations, shaking of hands was held necessary to blnd a bargain,—a custom stlll retained in verbal contracts. A sale thus made was’ called “handsale," (venditio per mufuam manum complexioncm.) In pro* cess of tlme the same word was used to slg-nlfy the prlce or earnest which was given immediately after the shaking of hands, or lnstead thereof. 2 Bl. Comm. 448
