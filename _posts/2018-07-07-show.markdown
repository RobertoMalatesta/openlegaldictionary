Although the words "show" and “indicate" are sometimes interchangeable in popular use, they are not always so. To “show" Is to make apparent or clear by evi-dence; to prove; while an “lndlcation" may be merely a symptom; that which points to or gives dlrectlon to the mind. Coyle ▼. Com., 104 Pa. 133
