If the plalntlff ln a plaint in the mayor’s court of London has attached property belonging to the defendant and ob-tained execution against the garnishee, the defendant, if he wishes to contest the plain-tiff’s claim, and obtain restoration of his property, must issue a scire facias ad dis-prob an dum debitum; lf the only question to be tried is the plaintiff's debt, the plaintiff in appearing to the scire facias prays stet billa “that his bill original," i. e., his orig-inal plaint, “may stand, and that the defend-ant may plead thereto.” The actlon then pro-ceeds ln the usual way as if the proceedings ln attachment (which are founded on a fictitious default of the defendant in appearing to the plaint) had not taken place. Brand, F. Attachm. 115; Sweet
