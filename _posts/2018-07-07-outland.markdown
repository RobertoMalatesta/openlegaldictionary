The Saxon thanes divided their hereditary lands into Inland, such as lay nearest their dwelling, which they kept' to their own use, and outland, which lay beyond the demesnes, and was granted out to tenants, at the will of the lord, like copy-hold estates. This outland they subdivided into two parts, one part they disposed among those who attended their persons, called "theodans," or lesser thanes; the oth-er part they allotted to thelr husbandmen, oq churls.
