Lat. An at-tempted partnership, ln which one party was to bear all the losses, and have no share ln the profits. This was a void partnership in Roman law; and, apparently, it would also be void as a partnership in English law, as being inherently inconsistent with the notion of partnership. (Dig. 17, 2, 29, 2.) Brown
