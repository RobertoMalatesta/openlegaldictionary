The name given by the canonists to deeds of which both partB were written on the 6ame piece of parchment, with some word or letters of the alphabet written between them, through which the parchment was cut in such a manner as to leave half the word on one part and half on the other. It thus corresponded to the chirograph or in-denture of the common law. 2 Bl. Comm 295, 296
