As used ln jurisprudence^ the word "necessary" does not always import an absolute physical necessity, so strong that one thing, to wbich another may be termed "necessary," cannot exist without that other. It frequently imports no more than that one thing is convenient or useful or esseutial to another. To employ the means necessary to an end is generally understood as employing any means calculated to produce the end, and not as being confined to those single means without which the end would be entirely un-attainable. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 wheat 316, 413, 4 L. Ed. 579
