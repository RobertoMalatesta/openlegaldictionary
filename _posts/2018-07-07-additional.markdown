This term embraces the idea of joining or uniting one thing to on-other, so as thereby to form one aggregate. Thus, “additional security” imports a secu-rity, which, united with or joined to the former one, is deemed to make it, as an ag-gregate, sufficient as a security from tbe be-ginning. State v. Hull, 53 Miss. 626
