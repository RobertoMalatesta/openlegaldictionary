A man that is born deaf, dumb, and blind ls looked upon by the law as ln the same state with an idlot, he being supposed incapable of any understand-ing. 1 Bl. Comm. 304. Nevertheless, a deaf and dumb person may be tried for felony if the prisoner can be made to understand by means of signs. 1 Leach, C. L. 102
