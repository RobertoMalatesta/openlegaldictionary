In common-law practice, the action of trover (or trover and conversion) is a species of action on the case, and origl-nally lay for the recovery of damages against a person who had found anotherâ€™s goods and wrongfully converted them to his own use. Subsequently the allegation of the loss of the goods by the plaintiff and the finding ot them by the defendant was merely fictitious, and the actlon became the remedy for any wrongful interference with or detention of the goods of another. 3 Steph. Comm. 426. Sweet. See Burnham v. PIdcock, 33 Misc Rep. 65, 66 N. Y. Supp. 800; Larson v. Daw
