St. okl. 1903, f 2068.) when so used, it appears always to mean confinement by competent public au-thority or under due legal process, wheresa “imprisonment” may be effected by a pri-. vate pcrson without warrant of law, and lf unjustifiable Is called “false imprisonment” No occurrence of such a phrase as “false incarceration” bas been noted. See Imprisonment
