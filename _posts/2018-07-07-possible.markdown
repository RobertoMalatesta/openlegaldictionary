Capable of existing or hap-peniug; feasible. . ln another sense, the word denotes extreme improbability, without excluding the idea of feasibility. It is also sometimes equivalent to “practicable” or “reasonable," as in some cases where action is required to be taken “as soon as possible.” See Palmer v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 44 wis. 208
