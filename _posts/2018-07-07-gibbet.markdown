A gallows; the post on which malefactors are hanged, or on which their bodies are exposed. It differs from a common gallows, in that it consists of one perpendicular post, from the top of which pro-ceeds one arm, except it be a double gibbet, which is formed in the shape of the Roman capital T. Enc. Loud
