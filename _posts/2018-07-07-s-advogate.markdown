OGATE. An Engllsh advo-cate who holds, in the courts in which the rules of the canon and civil law prevail, a similar position to that which the attorney geueral holds in the ordlnary courts, i. e., he acts as counsel for the crown in ecclesias-tical, admiralty, and probate cases, and ad-vises the crown on questions of international law. ln order of precedence it seems that he ranks after the attorney general. 3 Steph. Comm. 275n
