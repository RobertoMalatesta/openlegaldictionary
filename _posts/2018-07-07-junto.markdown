or JUNTO. A select council for taking cognizance of affairs of great consequence requiring secrecy; a cabal or faction. This was a popular nickname ap-plled to the whig ministry in England, between 1693-1696. They clung to each other for mutual protection against the attacks of the so-called “Reactionist Stuart Party.”
