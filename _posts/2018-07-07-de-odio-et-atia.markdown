A writ directed to the sheriff, commanding him to inquire whether a prisoner charged with murder was committed upon just cause of suspicion, or merely propter odium et atiam, (through ha-tred and ill will;) and if, upon the inquisi-tion, due cause of suspicion did not appear, then there issued another writ for the slier-iff to admit him to bail. 3 Bl. Comm. 128
