In English practice. A writ by which a suit or plaint in replevin may be removed from a county court to one of the courts of west-minster Hall. 3 Bl. Comm. 149; 3 Steph. PI 522, 666. So termed from the emphatic words of the old writ, by which the sheriff was commanded to cause the plaint to be recorded, and to have the record before the Â«ur perior court. Reg. Orig. 5b.
