To the person first applying. In probate practice, where there are several persons equally entitled to a grant of administration, (e. g., next of kin of the same degree,) the rule of the court is to make the grant priori pctenti, to the first applicant. Browne, Prob. Pr. 174; Coote, Prob. Pr. 173, 180
