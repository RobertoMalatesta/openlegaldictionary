To solicit and receive from another any article of property or thing of value with the intention and promise to re-pay or return lt or its equivalent. Strictly speaking, borrowing implies a gratuitous loan; if any price or consideration is to be paid for the use of the property, it ls “hir-ing.” But money may be "borrowed" on an agreement to pay interest for Its use.
