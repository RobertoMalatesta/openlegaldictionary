As soon as a notary has made presentment and demand of a bill of ex-change, or at some seasonable hour of tbe same day, he makes a minute on the bill, or on a ticket attached thereto, or in his book of registry, consisting of his Initials, the month, day, and year, the refusal of accept-ance or payment, the reason, if any, assigned for such refusal, and bis charges of protest. This is the preliminary step towards the pro-test, and is called “noting.” 2 Daniel, Neg. Inst. | 939
