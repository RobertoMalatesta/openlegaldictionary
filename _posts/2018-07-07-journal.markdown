A daily book; a book ln whlch entries are made or events recorded from day to day. In maritime law, the jour-nal (otherwise called “log” or “log-book”) is a book kept on every vessel, which contains a brief record of the events and occurrences of each day of a voyage, with the nautical observations, course of the ship, account of the weather, etc. In the system of double-entry book-keeping, the journal is an ac-count-book into which are transcribed, daily or at other intervals, the items entered up-on the day-book, for more convenient posting into the ledger. In the usage of leglsla-tive todies, the journal is a dally record of the proceedings of either house. It is kept by the clerk, and ln it are entered the ap-pointments and actions of committees, ln-troduction of bills, motions, votes, resolu-tlons, etc., in the order of their occurrence.
