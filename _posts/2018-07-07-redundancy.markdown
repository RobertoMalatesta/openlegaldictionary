This is the fault of introducing superfluous matter into a legal instrument; particularly the insertion in a pleading of matters foreign, extraneous, and Irrelevant to tljat which it ls intended to answer. See Carpenter v. Reynolds, 58 wis. 666, 17 N. W. 300; Carpenter v. west, 5 How. Prac. (N. Y.) 55; Bowman v. Sheldon, 6 Sandf. (N. Y.) 660
