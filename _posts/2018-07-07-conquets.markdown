In French law. The name given to every acquisition which the hus-band and wife, jointly or severally, make during the conjugal community. Thus, what-ever is acquired by the husband and wife, either by his or her industry or good fortune, inures to the extent of one-half for the bene-flt of the other. Merl. Repert. "Conquet" Picotte v. Cooley, 10 Mo. 312
