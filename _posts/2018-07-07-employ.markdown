To engage ln one’s service; to use as an agent or substitute in transact-lng business; to commission and intrust with the management of one’s affairs; and, when used in respect to a servant or hired laborer, the term is equivalent to hiring, which im-plies a request and a contract for a compen-satlon, and has but this one meaning when used in the ordinary affairs and business of life.
