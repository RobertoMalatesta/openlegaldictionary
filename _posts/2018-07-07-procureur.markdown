In French law. An at-torney-; one who has received a commission from another to act on his behalf. There were in France two classes of procureurs: Procureurs ad ncgotia, appointed by an individual to act for him in the administration of his affairs; persons invested with a power of attorney; corresponding to “attorneys in fact.” Procureurs ad lites were persons ap-polnted and authorized to act for a party ln a court of Justice. These corresponded to at-torneys at law, (now called, ln England, “solicitors of the supreme court.”) The order of procureurs was abolished ln 1791, and that of ovouts established in their place.
