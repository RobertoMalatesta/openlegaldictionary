In lnsurance law. To stop at a port If there be liberty granted hy the policy to touch, or to touch and stay, at an intermediate port on the passage, the better opinion now ls that the Insured may trade there, when consistent with the object and the furtherance of the adventure, by breaking bulk, or by discharging and taking in cargo, provided it produces no unnecessary delay, nor enhances nor varies the risk. 3 Kent, Comm. 314
