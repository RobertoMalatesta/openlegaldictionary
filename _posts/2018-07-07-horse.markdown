An animal of the genus equus and species caballus. In a narrow and strict sense, the term Ib applied only to the male, and only to males of four years old or there-abouts, younger horses being called “colts.” But even ln this sense the term Includes both stallions and geldings. In a wider sense, and as generally used ln statutes, the word is taken as nomcn gcneralissimum, and in-cludes not only horses strictly so called, but also colts, mares and fillies, and mules and asses.
