L. Fr. It seems; it would appear. Thls expresslon is often used in the reports to preface a statement by the court upon a polnt of law whlch Is not directly decided, when such statement is intended as an Intimation of what the decision would be if the point were necessary to be passed up-on. It is also used to introduce a suggestion by the reporter, or his understanding of the point decided when It is not free from obscurity
