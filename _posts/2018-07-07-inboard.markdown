In maritime law, and particularly wlth reference to the stowage of cargo, thls term is contrasted with “out-board." It does not necessarily mean under deck, but Is applied to a cargo so piled or stowed that.it does not project over tbe “board" (side or rail) of the vessel. See Al-len v. St Louis Ins. Co., 46 N. Y. Super. Ct 181
