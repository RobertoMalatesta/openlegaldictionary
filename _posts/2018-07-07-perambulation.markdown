The act of walk-ing over the boundaries of a district or piece of land, either for the purpose of determining them or of preserving evidence of them. Thus, in many parishes in England, it ls the custom for the parishioners to perambulate the boundaries of the parish ln rogation week in every year. Such a custom entitles them to enter any manâ€™s land and abate nuisances ln their way. Phillim. Ecc. Law, 1867; Hunt, Bound. 103; Sweet See Greenville v. Mason, 57 N. H. 385
