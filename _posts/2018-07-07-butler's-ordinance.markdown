In English law. A law for the heir to punish waste in the life of the ancestor. “Though it be on record in the parliament book of Edward I., yet it never was a statute, nor ever so received; but only some constitution of. the king's council, or lords in parliament, which never obtained the strength or force of an act of parliament.” Hale, Hist. Eng. Law, p. 18
