A term sometimes em-ployed to describe verbiage inserted in a pleading or indictment, over and above what is necessary to he set forth; or an objection to a plea or indictment on the ground of its failing to include such superfluous matter. See State v. Galllmon, 24 N. C. 377; State v. Peak, 130 N. C. 711, 41 S. E. 887
