A purpresture may be defined as an inclosure by a private party of a part of that which belongs to and ought to be open and free to the enjoyment of the public at large. It is not necessarily a public nuisance. A public nuisance must be something which subjects the public to some de-gree of inconvenience or annoyance; but a purpresture may exist without putting the publlc to any inconvenience whatever. Attorney General v. Evart Booming Co., 34 Midi. 462. And see Cobb v. Lincoln Park Com’rs, 202 111. 427, 67 N. E. 5, 63 L. R. A. 264, 95 Am. St. Rep. 258; Columbus v. Jaques, 30 Ga. 506; Sullivan v.
