A judgment <n rem is an adjudication, pronounced upon the status of some particular subject-matter, by a tribunal having competent authority for that purpose. It differs from a judgment in personam, in this; that the latter Judgment ls ln form, as well as substance, between the parties claiming the right; and that it is so inter partes appears by the rec-ord itself. It is binding only upon the par-ties appearing to be such by the record, and those claiming by them. A judgment in rcm is founded on a proceeding instituted, not against the person, as such, but against or upon the thing or subject-matter Itself, whose state or condition is to be determin-ed. It ls a proceeding to determine the state or condltion of the thing itself; and the judgment is a solemn declaration upon the status of the thing, and lt ipso facto renders It what lt declares it to be. woodruff v.
