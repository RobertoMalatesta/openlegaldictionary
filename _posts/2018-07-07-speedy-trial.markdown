In criminal law. As secured by constitutional guaranties, a speedy trial means a trial conducted according to fixed rules, regulations, and proceedings of law, free from vexatious, capricious, and op-pressive delays manufactured by the minis-ters of justice. See People v. Hall, 51 App. Div. 57, 64 N. Y. Supp. 433; Nixon v. State, 2 Smedes & M. (Miss.) 507, 41 Am. Dec. 601
