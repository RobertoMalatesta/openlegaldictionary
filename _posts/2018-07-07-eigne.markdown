L. Fr. Eldest; eldest-born. The term is of common occurrence in the old books. Thus, bastard eigne means an illegit-imate son whose parents afterwards marry and have a second son for lawful lssue, the latter being called muUcr puisne, (after-born.) Eigne is probably a corrupt form of the French “altte.” 2 Bl. Comm. 248; Litt. | 399
