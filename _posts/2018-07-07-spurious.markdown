Not proceeding from the •true source; not genuine; counterfeited. “A spurious bank-bill may be a legitimate lm-pression from the genuine plate, but it must have the signatures of persons not the officers of the bank whence lt purports to have issued, or else the names of fictitious persons. A spurlous bill, also, may be an Ulegitlmate im-pression from a genulne plate, or an lmpres-sion from a counterfeit plate, but lt must have Buch signatures or names as we have Just indicated. A bill, therefore, may be both counterfeit and forged, or both counterfeit end spurious, but it cannot be both forged and spurious." Kirby v. State, 1 ohlo St 187
