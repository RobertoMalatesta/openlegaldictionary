That part of any open field or place that was allotted for corn or hay, and upon which there was no common or feeding, was anciently said to be in defenso; so of any meadow grouud that was laid ln for hay only. The same term was applied to a wood where part was inclosed or fenced, to secure the growth of the underwood from the injury of cattle. Cowell
