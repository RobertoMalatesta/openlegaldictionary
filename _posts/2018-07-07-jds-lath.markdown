In Roman law. The rlght of Latium or of the Latins. The principal privllege of the Latins seems to have been the use of their own laws, and their not be-lng subject to the edicts of the prtetor, and that they had occasional access to the free-dom of Rome, and a participation in her sacred rites. Butl. Hor. Jur. 41
