A species of tenure by knight service, which was due to the king only, and was distinguished Into grand and petit serjeanty. The tenant holding hy grand serjeanty was bound, Instead of attending the king generally in his wars, to do some honorary service to the king in person, as to carry hls banner or sword, or to be hls butler, champlon, or other officer at his coronation. Petit serjeanty differed from grand serjeanty, in that the service rendered to the king was not of a personal nature, but consisted ln rendering bim annually some small implement of war, as a bow, sword, arrow, lance, or the like. Cowell; Brown
