Thia word, as an adverb, means “at that time,” referring to a time specified, either past or future. It has no power in itself to fix a time. It simply refers to a time already fixed. Mangum v. Piester, 16 S. C. 329. lt may also denote a contingency, and he equivalent to “in that event” Pin-tard v. Irwin, 20 N. J. Law, 505
