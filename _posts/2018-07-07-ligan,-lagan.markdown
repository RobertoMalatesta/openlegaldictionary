Goods cast Into the sea tied to a buoy, so that they may be found again by the owners, are so denominated. when goods are cast into the sea ln storms or shipwrecks, and remain there, without coming to land, they are distinguish-ed by the barbarous names of “Jetsam," “flotsam," and ‘ligan.” 5* Coke, 108; Harg. State Tr. 48; 1 Bl. Comm. 292
