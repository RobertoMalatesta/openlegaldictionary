Certain articles or ordinances drawn up by Archbishop Parker and some of tbe bishops in 1564, at the request of Queen Elizabeth, the object of which was to enforce decency and uniformity in the ritual of the church. The queen subsequent* ly refused to give her official sanction to these advertisements, and left them to be enforced by the bishops under their general powers. Phillim. Ecc. Law, 910; 2 Prob. Dlv. 276; Id. 354
