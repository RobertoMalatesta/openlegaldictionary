In such phrases as “to the hurt or annoyance of another,” or “hurt, molest-ed, or restrained in his person or estate," this word is not restricted to physical in-juries, but Includes also mental pain, as well as discomfort or annoyance. See Row-land v. Miller (Super. N. Y.) 15 N. Y. Supp. 702; Pronk v. Brooklyn Heights R. Co., 68 App. Div. 390, 74 N. T. Supp. 375; Thurston v. whitney, 2 Cush. (Mass.) 110
