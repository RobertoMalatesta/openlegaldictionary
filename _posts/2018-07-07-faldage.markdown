The privilege which anclent-ly several lords reserved to themselves of set-tiDg up folds for sheep in any fields within their manors, the better to manure them, and this not only with their own but their tenants’ sheep. Called, variously, “secta fal-dare,” “fold-course,” “free-fold," “faldagii." Cowell; Spelman
