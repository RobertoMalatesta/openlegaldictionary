As applied to an estate, perdurable signifies lasting long or forever. Thus, a disseisor or tenant in fee upon con-dltion has as high and great an estate as the rightful owner or tenant in fee-simple absolute, but not so perdurable. The term ls chiefly used with reference to the extinguish-ment of rights by unity of seisin, which does hot take place unless both the right and the land out of which it issues are held for equal* ly high and perdurable estates.
