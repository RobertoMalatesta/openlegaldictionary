The statute law of New Jer-sey recoguizes three different kinds of roads: A public road, a private road, aud a byroad. A by-road is a road used by the in-habitants, and recognized by statute, but not laid out. Such roads are often called “drift-ways.” They are roads of necessity ln new-ly-settled countries. Van Blarcom v. Frike, 29 N. J. Law, 516. See, also, Stevens v. Allen, 29 N. J. Law, 68
