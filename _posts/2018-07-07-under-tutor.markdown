In Louisiana. In every tutorship there shall be an under-tutor, whom it shall be the duty of the judge to appoint at the time letters of tutor-ship are certified for the tutor. It is the duty of the under-tutor to act for the minor whenever the interest of the minor is in opposition to the interest of the tutor. Civ. Code La. 1838, arts. 300, 301
