In English law. The bar at which those barristers, usually junlor men, practice who have not yet been raised to the dignity of kingâ€™s counsel. These junior barristers are said to plead without the bar; while those of the higher rank are admitted to seats within the bar, and ad-dress the court or a jury from a place re-served for them, and divided off by a bar.
