Men who used in former days to ply about courts of law, so called from their manner of makiug known their occupation, (i. e., hy a straw iu one of their shoes,) recognized by the name of “straw-shoes.” An advocate or lawyer who wanted a convenient witness knew by these signs where to meet with one, and the col-loquy between the parties was brief. “Don’t you remember?” said the advocate; to which the ready answer was, “To be sure I do.” “Then come into court and swear it.” And straw-shoes went into court aud swore. Ath-ens abounded in straw-shoes. Quart. Rev. vol. 33, p. 344
