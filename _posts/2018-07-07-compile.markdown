To compile ls to copy from various authors into one work. Between a compilation and an abridgment there ls a dear distinction. A compilation consists of selected extracts from different authors; an abridgment is a condensation of the views of one author. Story v. Holcombe, 4 McLean, 306, 314, Fed. Cas. No. 13,497
