A court having the jurisdiction of a chancellor; a court administering equity and proceeding accord-tag to the forms and principles of equity. In England^ prior to the judicature acts, the style of the court possessing the largest equi-table powers and jurisdiction was the “high conrt of chancery." In some of the United States, the title "court of chancery” is ap-plied to a court possessing general equity powers, distinct from the courts of common law. Parmeter ▼. Bourne, 8 wash. 45, 35 Pac. 586
