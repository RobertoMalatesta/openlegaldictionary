The name given by the glossators to the second of the three purts or volumes into which the Pandects were di-vided. The glossators at Bologna had at first only two parts, the first called “Digestum Vetus," (the old Digest,) pnd the last call-ed “Digestum Novum,” (the New Digest.) When they afterwards received the middle or second part, they separated from the Digestum Novum the beginning it had then, and added it to the second part, from which enlargement the latter received the name “In-Jortiatum” Mackeld. Rom. Law, § 110
