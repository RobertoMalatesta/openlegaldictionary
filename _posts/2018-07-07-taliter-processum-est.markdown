Upon pleading the judgment of an inferior court, the proceedings preliminary to such judg-ment, and on which the same was founded, must, to some extent, appear in the plead-ing, but the rule Is that they may be alleged with a general allegation that “such pro-ceedings were had,” Instead of a detailed account of the proceedings themselves, and this general allegatlon is called the “tal iter processum est" A like concise mode of stat-ing former proceedings ln a . suit is adopted at the present day in chancery proceedings upon petitions and ln actions in the nature of bills of revivor and supplement.
