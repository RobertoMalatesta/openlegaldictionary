The rector of a chnrch; one that has full possession of all the rights of a parochial church. The appellation of “parson,” however it may be depreciated by familiar, clownish, and indiscriminate use, ls the most legal, most beneficial, and most honorable title that a parish priest can en-joy, because such a one, Sir Edward Coke observes, and he only, is eald vicem seu personam ecclesiw gcrerc. (to represent and bear the person of the church.) 1 Bl. Comm. 384
