A carnal copulation against nature; and this is either by the confusion of species,—that is to say, a man or a woman with a brute beast,—or of sexes, as a man with a man, or man unnaturally with a wo-man. 3 Inst 58; 12 Coke, 36. Ausman v. Veal, 10 Ind. 356, 71 Am. Dec. 331; Com. v. J., 21 Pa. Co. Ct. R. 626
