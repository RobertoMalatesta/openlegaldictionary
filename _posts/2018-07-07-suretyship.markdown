The contract of suretyship is that whereby one obligates himself to pay the debt of another in consideration of credit or indulgence, or other benefit given to his principal, the principal remaining bonnd therefor. It differs from a guaranty in this: that the consideration of the latter is a benefit flowing to the guarantor. Code Ga. 1882, | 2148. See Subett
