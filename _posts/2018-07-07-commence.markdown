To commence a suit is to demand something by the institution of pro-cess in a court of justice. Cohens v. Vir-ginia, 6 wheat 408, 5 L. Ed. 257. To “bring” a suit is an equivalent term; an action is “commenced” when it is “brought,” and vice versa. Goldeuberg v. Murphy, 108 U. S. 162, 2 Sup. CL 388, 27 L. Ed. 686
