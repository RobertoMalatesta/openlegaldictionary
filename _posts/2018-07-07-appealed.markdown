In a sense not strictly technical, this word may be used to signify the exercise by a party of the right to re-move a litigation from one forum to another; as where he removes a suit involving the title to real estate from a Justiceâ€™s court to the common pleas. Lawrence v. Souther, 8 Metc. (Mass.) 166
