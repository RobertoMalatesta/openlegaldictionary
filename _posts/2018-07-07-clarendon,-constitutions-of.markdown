The constitutions of Clarendon were certain statutes made in the reign of Henry II. of England, at a parliament held at Clarendon, (A. D. 1164,) by which the king checked the power of the pope and hls clergy, and great-ly narrowed the exemption they claimed from secular jurisdiction. 4 Bl. Comm. 422.
