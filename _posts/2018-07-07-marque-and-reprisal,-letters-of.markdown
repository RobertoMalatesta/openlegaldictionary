These words, “marque” and “reprisal," are frequently used as synony-mous, but, taken in thelr strict etymological sense, the latter signifies a “taking in re-turn;” the former, the passing the frontiers (marches) in order to such taking. Letters of marque and reprisal are grantable, by the law of nations, whenever the subjects of one state are oppressed and injured by those of another, and justice is denied by that state to which the oppressor belongs; and the par-ty to whom these letters are granted may then seize the bodies or the goods of the sub-jects of the state to which the offender be-iongs, until satisfaction be made, wherever they happen to be found. Reprisals are to be grauted only In case of a clear and open denial of Justice. At the present day, ln consequence partly of treaties and partly of the practice of nations, the making of reprisals is confined to the seizure of commer* dal property on the high seas by public cruisers, or by private cruisers specially au-thorized thereto.
