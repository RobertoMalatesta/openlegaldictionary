In medical juris-prudence. A trick or deceit of the senses; a morbld error either of the sense of sight or that of hearlng, or posslbly of the other senses; a psychological state, such as would be produced naturally by an act of sense-per-ceptlon, attrlhuted confidently, but mistaken-ly, to something which has no objective exlst-ence; as, when the patient imagines that he sees an object when there ls none, or hears a voice or other sound when nothing strikes his ear. See Staples v. wellington, 58 Me. 459; Foster v. Dickerson, 64 VL 233, 24 Atl. 257; McNett v. Cooper (C. C.) 13 Fed. 590; People v. Krist, 168 N. Y. 19, 60 N. E. 1057
