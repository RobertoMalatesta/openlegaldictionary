The word â€œboulevard," whlch originally indicated a bulwark or ram-part, and was afterwards applled to a pub-lic walk or road on the site of a demolished fortification, is now employed ln the same sense as publlc drive. A park is a piece of ground adapted and set apart for purposes of ornament, exercise, and amusement It is not a street or road, though carriages may pass through it
